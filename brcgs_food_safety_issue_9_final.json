A suitable procedure must be\nin place to manage any mistakes that are made (e.g. neatly crossing through the ‘inaccurate’\ninformation, noting the reason for the error and giving the initials of the person making\nthe change). Note that the use of correction fluid is not acceptable as this makes the initial\ninformation illegible.\nRecords must be retrievable when required (e.g. during an audit or the investigation of a\ncustomer complaint), and must therefore be maintained and stored to allow this (e.g. by\nbeing appropriately filed by date or reference number and in such a way that they are still\nlegible within the specified storage timeframe).

    "interpretation_guidance": "Internal audit programme\nThe scope of internal audits needs to be established and must ensure that all aspects\nof the food safety and quality management systems (including the HACCP programme,\nprerequisite programmes, policies, documentation, hygiene and production), the product\nsafety and quality culture plan, and systems associated with authenticity, product legality\nand quality management are audited at least annually.\nAll the internal audits should not be conducted on a single day; nor should every internal\naudit attempt to cover all aspects of the food safety and quality management system or\nthe Standard. A once-a-year check against all the requirements of the Standard may be of\nvalue as a gap analysis when preparing for an audit or confirming the contents of the food\nsafety and quality management systems, but is insufficient to cover the full requirements\nof an internal audit programme as it will not provide the depth of assessment or level of\nconfidence required.\nDevelopment of the internal audit schedule should begin with a risk assessment. The aim of\nthis is to identify:\n- all the areas or activities that need to be audited\n- the frequency with which each part of the product safety and quality management system\nneeds to be audited. This will be dependent on the risk inherent in each activity or section\nof the food safety and quality management system. For example, the site should be aware\nof the consequences of not complying with its own systems, which could lead to hazards\nnot being identified in a timely manner. Therefore internal audits of CCPs are likely to be\nmore frequent than those for less critical activities.\nFrequency may also be influenced by known issues within the company or customer\nrequirements. This may result in a site needing to audit an activity multiple times\nthroughout the year, or developing a programme with more than four internal audit dates\n(see below)\n72 brcgs.com\nClause\nRequirements\nInterpretation\ncontinued\n- the most relevant dates for each internal audit; for example, if activities or processes are\nseasonal (see below) or if specific activities need to be completed more than once a year.\nSites may also find it useful to consider completing internal audits during different shifts,\nincluding, for example, nights or weekends.\nThe majority of sites are likely to benefit from a programme of audit dates spread diversely\nthroughout the year, as this maximises the opportunity to identify any non-conforming\nprocesses in a timely manner, allowing correction and minimising the potential for standards\nto fall between audits. The Standard promotes this concept by requiring a minimum of\nfour audit dates spread throughout the year. However, it does not require all audits to be\ncompleted quarterly, as there may be genuine situations where risk assessment shows an\nalternative frequency. Seasonality is an example; if a site is open only for part of the year,\nthen there is little value in completing internal audits while the site is shut. For seasonal\nproduction, the site is not expected to complete a series of internal audits when the site is\nnot operating; however, there must be a system for the management of start-up processes,\nand internal audits are therefore expected to start before the season commences to ensure\nthe site is ready to start production. For example, the HACCP programme should be audited\nto ensure that it is up to date and appropriate for the forthcoming production; that hygiene\nand fabrication are correct; and that staff are appropriately trained. The remaining areas of\nthe internal audit programme should be covered throughout the season. Further information\nis available in the BRCGS Fresh Produce Guideline available from BRCGS Participate or the\nBRCGS Store.\nEven where a site is open throughout the year, seasonality can affect the internal audit\ndates; for example, if certain activities, such as the harvest of grapes or bottling of wine, are\nonly completed at certain times, or if there are seasonal changes in production volumes\nwhich apply a greater burden on the product safety systems at certain times of year. Where\na site is part of a multi-site company, and the company conducts annual corporate food\nsafety audits, it is acceptable for this annual audit to be incorporated into the internal audit\nschedule. However, additional internal audits that look at specific parts of the food safety\nand quality system, and compliance with the Standard, should be scheduled throughout the\nrest of the year.\nThe most common way of completing an internal audit is by taking documented procedures\nand work instructions and comparing them with the actual working practices and records.\nNote that a tick-box exercise is not sufficient, as it does not provide the rigour or depth that\nan effective internal audit programme requires.\nThe use of an external consultant (e.g. by small sites) is acceptable, providing the internal\naudit programme is scheduled throughout the year and not in a single block of activity.\nSee clause 1.2.4 and section 3.5.3 for details relating to the requirements for product safety\nconsultants.\nBRCGS has produced a guideline to internal auditing which is available on\nBRCGS Participate or from the BRCGS Store."

    "interpretation_guidance": "Internal audit records and corrective actions\nThe management review processes (see clause 1.1.4) must ensure that the internal audit\nprogramme operates effectively and that necessary corrective or preventive actions are\nappropriately completed. As a result, the internal audit process will often contain a number\nof steps. For example:\n- internal audit completed\n- corrective actions agreed\n- corrective actions completed and signed off\n- completion verified\n- root cause analysis used to identify any necessary preventive actions\n- preventive actions completed and reviewed\n- overall management review completed.\nEach internal audit must examine the process or activity in detail and will usually include a\nnumber of activities such as:\n- observing how activities are completed\n- asking relevant staff how an activity is completed or why it is completed in a specific way\n- reviewing procedures and records to confirm whether the activity has been completed and\nrecorded correctly.\nIn addition to the actual internal audit, it is important that appropriate reports are\ncompleted, clearly indicating what was audited, the actions that are agreed and the review of\nthese actions.\nReports must show evidence of conformity as well as non-conformity, with objective\nsupporting evidence (e.g. what documents or actions were observed). Some sites have also\nfound it useful to include recommendations for improvement, where the audit can highlight\nany that are noted during the audit.\nTick lists showing that items have been assessed will not normally be accepted as the\nonly form of evidence; information showing how the audited items have fulfilled the\nrequirements, or how they are non-compliant, is required. This is important, as recording\nconformity is documenting evidence that due diligence is taking place; in other words,\nthat required procedures are taking place, and have been observed by auditors who are\nindependent of the process. This may subsequently be useful, for example, in the event of\nan incident, or for answering questions from regulatory authorities or customers.\nI\nClause\nRequirements\nInterpretation\ncontinued\nNotes, references or copies of the documents and records should be kept as evidence of\naspects that have been examined, to allow an independent reviewer to reach the same\nconclusion as the internal auditor. For example, the dates and titles of records that were\ninspected should be noted in sufficient detail to allow them to be traced; if any records are\nnon-compliant, precise details of the non-compliance should be given. The listing of records\nreviewed also ensures that a wide range of records are considered (e.g. training records of\na variety of staff rather than repeated audits of the same records). Records will also confirm\nwhether anything has changed since the last audit.\nThe Standard is not prescriptive regarding the format of the internal audit reports; for\nexample, they may be hand-written, stand-alone electronic documents or uploaded into a\ncompany database. Good practice is to retain any auditor notes that are completed during\nthe audit, as well as the final report. Figure 9 shows a typical example of a completed audit\nreport.\nThe results of audits need to be communicated to the relevant staff; i.e. those who are\nresponsible for the area or activity, and corrective actions, root cause and preventive\nactions and timescales for their completion agreed. This may be achieved via operational\nor review meetings, or via an update at the end of the audit combined with documentation\nsuch as a memo or a copy of the audit report. Responsibility for corrective actions must be\ndocumented – for example, by being recorded on the audit record sheet. Full details for\nhandling non-conformities, including corrective and preventive actions, are provided in\nsection 3.7.\nNote that finding a non-conformity during an internal audit should not necessarily be\nviewed as a negative, since it allows the site to implement action before the non-conformity\nbecomes a more serious problem.\nWhere non-conformities have been identified, effective completion of corrective and\npreventive action must be verified. Good practice is to ensure that a nominated member\nof staff with the appropriate authority checks that the action has been taken within the\nagreed timescale, and that this has rectified the problem sufficiently to prevent recurrence.\nThe nominated staff member should not be the person responsible for completion of the\nactions; ideally this should be the original auditor.\nGood practice is to complete a review of the internal audit programme; for example, looking\nat the outputs and trends, and any insight these provide. A summary of the programme and\nresults will also be required for the management review meeting (see clause 1.1.4).\nA non-conformity will be raised against clause 3.4.3 if there is a non-conformity in the\noperation of the internal audit programme itself. Examples include if the audit schedule is\nnot properly implemented or if corrective and preventive actions are not completed within\nthe agreed timescales.\nWhere the site consistently obtains negative results (i.e. no non-conformities are identified\nthroughout the scheduled programme) good practice is to review the programme to ensure\nit is operating robustly; for example, to:\n- consider if all activities are correctly incorporated into the programme\n- review rigour, robustness and consistency of the internal audits.\n76 brcgs.com\nClause\nRequirements\nInterpretation\ncontinued\nFull records of all internal audits and the results, including conformities and nonconformities and verification of corrective and preventive actions, must be kept for a defined\nperiod, typically 2 years.\nBRC REQUIREMENT\nSITE POLICY\nEVIDENCE\nCOMPLIES\nThe site shall ensure that any\nout of speciﬁcation product is\neﬀectively managed to prevent\nunauthorised release.\nProcedure QM11 & form QRec11.\nAll non-conformities trended for inclusion in management\nreview meetings (log reviewed and management report for\n1/9/21)\nY\nWaste disposal records checked (Sept – Dec 21) against\nrecords of non-conformities – disposal of outer packaging\non 1/1/22 unaccounted for.\nN\nThere shall be documented\nprocedures for managing\nnon-conforming products.\nProcedure QM11 – speciﬁes all\nrequirements – non-conforming products\nare stored in identiﬁed area and labelled\n‘on hold’, ‘reject’ or ‘QC pass’.

    "interpretation_guidance": "Documented inspections\nIn addition to the internal audit programme the Standard requires a programme of\ndocumented inspections to ensure that the factory environment and processing equipment\nare maintained in a suitable condition. These inspections are different from the internal\naudit programme specified in clauses 3.4.1 to 3.4.3, which examines practices against\ndocumented procedures. Audits are an in-depth challenge to the systems and procedures\nthat a site has put in place to manage hazards, to confirm that the site is effectively\nmitigating identified risks. A documented inspection, however, is a simpler approach to\nassessing the conditions present, so an entirely separate inspection plan should be in place.\nThese hygiene- and fabrication-based inspections assess standards of cleaning, equipment,\nbuilding fabrication and personal hygiene to ensure that high standards are maintained and\nthat a safe, hygienic production environment is in place. For example, inspections should\ninclude:\n- appropriateness, status, state of repair and cleaning of doors, walls, floors and other\nfabrication and facilities (e.g. those detailed in section 4.4)\n- hygiene inspection to confirm equipment and facilities have been suitably cleaned\n- equipment inspection to identify and control potential foreign bodies (e.g. from worn or\ndamaged equipment) before they have the opportunity to contaminate a product.\nThe frequency of the inspections should be based on risk. For open product areas,\ninspections need to be at least monthly, whereas inspections in high-care and high-risk areas\nare likely to be more frequent (e.g. daily or weekly); seasonal products or activities should be\nincluded where appropriate. Line start-up checks, which may occur daily or at shift changes\nin many operations, can form part of this inspection programme.\nIt is also good practice to complete inspections after any activities that potentially change\nthe risk to products; for example, after maintenance.\nA review of the inspection programme should be completed prior to any changes which may\naffect food safety; for example:\n78 brcgs.com\nClause\nRequirements\nInterpretation\ncontinued\n- introducing new equipment or facilities\n- changes to products\n- changes to processing conditions or process flow\n- following a non-conformity in an audit (e.g. internal, BRCGS, customer, or regulatory audit)\nor an independent inspection (e.g. following recommendations for improvement from the\npest control in-depth survey).\nThe individuals responsible for completing these inspections should be suitably trained\nfor the systems they are checking. However, staff completing hygiene and fabrication\ninspections do not need the same level of training as internal auditors.\nThe absolute requirements for independence identified in clause 3.4.2 do not always apply\nto these inspections; for example, it would be acceptable for line start-up checks to be\ncarried out by line supervisors or managers. External agencies may be used to carry out\ninspections.\nIt is important that issues identified at the inspections are corrected as soon as possible so\nthat product risk is minimised. The records of inspections and corrective actions must be\nretained.\nInspection records can provide useful information to identify trends and drive\nimprovements (e.g. through the use of scored inspection results).

They will include one or more of the\nfollowing activities:\n- Certification to the relevant BRCGS Standard, such as the Global Standard Food Safety;\nPackaging Materials; Storage and Distribution; Agents and Brokers; or another of the\nGFSI-benchmarked schemes. The site must confirm the validity of the certification. This\nwill include:\n- Confirmation of the certification status (e.g. this can be confirmed on an independent\ndatabase; for BRCGS Standards it can be confirmed in the BRCGS Directory).\nPhotocopies of certificates are not recommended and on their own are not considered\nsuitable validation of certification status.

Where the\nproduct has been excluded from the scope of certification it cannot be assumed that\nall of the processes relating to its manufacture have been conducted in accordance\nwith the certification requirements. For example, different facilities or equipment may\nbe used; different raw material suppliers or risk assessment; or different staff training.\nTherefore the site will need to undertake additional supplier approval processes to\nensure the material is satisfactory and any risks are appropriately managed.\nA successful site audit covers at a minimum product safety, traceability, HACCP, product\nsecurity and the food defence plan (i.e. systems to protect the product from theft and\nmalicious activity), product authenticity and good manufacturing processes. This audit must\nbe completed by an appropriately experienced and competent auditor (i.e. someone who has\ncompleted training in auditing techniques, has experience of auditing, and has knowledge of\nthe product, ingredient or processes being audited). Non-conformities should be addressed\n(e.g. in an agreed action plan with timescales) unless they are critical to product safety or\nlegality, in which case supply should not be permitted until the non-conformities have been\nsatisfactorily addressed.\nWhen deciding the type of supplier audit to complete the company should consider the\nrisks associated with the raw material and supplier, using this information to decide the\nformat and duration of the audit, and whether the risk assessment indicates that some or\nall of the requirements can be completed remotely, or whether an entirely on-site audit is\nrequired.\nIf the raw material supplier is independently audited to another standard that is not GFSIbenchmarked, this may be acceptable as an alternative to the site completing its own audit\nof the supplier providing that:\n- the scope of the audit meets the requirements of the Standard (i.e. at a minimum product\nsafety, traceability, HACCP review, product security and food defence, food authenticity\nand good manufacturing practices)\n- the site has a copy of the full audit report (not just a certificate)\n- the supplier can demonstrate the competence of the auditor.\nWhere risk assessment (completed as part of this clause) indicates that a supplier is low\nrisk (e.g. due to history of trading with the site or the nature of the raw materials traded)\nthe completion of a supplier questionnaire with a focus on food safety and quality may\nbe sufficient.

Therefore sites must ensure that their raw material suppliers\n(including primary packaging suppliers) have suitable traceability systems in operation. This\nassurance can be obtained from certification, auditing or by directly testing traceability.\nExamples of acceptable traceability include:\n- The raw material supplier is certificated to a GFSI-benchmarked standard. Assessment\nof traceability systems forms part of these audits and therefore no additional action is\nrequired to comply with the requirements of this clause; however, a communication\nmechanism should be in place, such that if the raw material supplier were no longer\ncertificated, the site would be made aware of this change.\n- The raw material supplier is audited by the site and the audit includes an assessment of\nthe traceability systems. This would comply with the requirement as traceability has been\nassessed. The audit should be repeated at least every 3 years.\n- Verification of a supplier’s traceability system where approval has been based solely on a\nquestionnaire with no additional testing (unless the raw material is a primary agricultural\nproduct purchased directly from a farm or fishery, where additional testing of the\ntraceability systems is not mandatory). This verification could include, for example:\n- A test of the raw material supplier’s traceability. For example, as part of the site’s\ntraceability test (see clause 3.9.3), a relevant ingredient is highlighted. The ingredient and\nbatch details are forwarded to the supplier to enable them to complete the traceability\ntest for the specific batch of raw materials and forward the relevant records back to the\nsite.\nI\nClause\nRequirements\nInterpretation\ncontinued\n- A worked example from the raw material supplier, which clearly explains the traceability\nprocess.\n- A detailed description of the traceability system provided by the raw material supplier.\nInformation received during the traceability verification should be incorporated into the\nsupplier approval process (clause 3.5.1.2).\nWhere the supplier is not the manufacturer, packer or consolidator of the raw material (e.g.\npurchased from an agent, broker or wholesaler) and approval is based on a questionnaire\ninstead of certification or audit, the verification of the traceability system required by this\nclause shall be carried out on the last manufacturer, packer or consolidator of the raw\nmaterial. Therefore, where the:\n- agent/broker is certificated to a BRCGS Standard or a standard benchmarked by GFSI, the\nassessment of supplier approval forms part of these audits and therefore no additional\naction is required to comply with the requirements of this clause (see clause 3.5.1.5 for\nfurther information)\n- last manufacturer, packer or consolidator is certificated to a BRCGS Standard or a standard\nbenchmarked by GFSI, the assessment of supplier approval forms part of these audits and\ntherefore no additional action is required to comply with the requirements of this clause\n- last manufacturer, packer or consolidator is audited as part of the supplier approval\nprocess, and the audit includes an assessment of the traceability systems, this would\ncomply with the requirement as traceability has been assessed.\nTraceability verification is a requirement for each raw material supplier. Therefore any\ntraceability test (because the supplier approval is based solely on a questionnaire) should\nbe designed to test the raw material supplier’s systems and not to trace every single material\nthey produce. Where a site purchases multiple ingredients from the same raw material\nsupplier, it is not a requirement to complete a traceability test for every single ingredient\npurchased; only to complete the traceability test for each supplier from which ingredients\nare purchased.\nThe frequency of the traceability verification should link to the supplier approval\nprogramme; that is, the traceability is verified on first approval of the supplier, and then at\nleast every 3 years. It is good practice to phase these verifications over the 3-year period\nrather than trying to complete them for all sites at once. Therefore sites that are new\nto certification (i.e. at their initial audit) may not have fully completed the traceability\nassessment for all of their suppliers, but should be able to demonstrate verification of the\ntraceability system for at least a third of the suppliers in the first year, prioritising the higherrisk materials; two-thirds completed within the second year; and all suppliers by the third\nyear.\nDuring the BRCGS audit the auditor will not undertake a test of raw material suppliers’\ntraceability systems but they will review the site’s processes and the information received\nfrom its raw material suppliers.\nIssues arise with raw materials from time to time so it is beneficial to consider the\nmonitoring of any materials that may need further transparency within the supply chain.\nThis ensures that the site is proactive, not reactive, potentially mitigating the risk of future\nconcerns about raw materials.\n88 brcgs.com\nClause\nRequirements"

Root cause analysis is a process of conducting an investigation into an\nidentified problem to allow the investigator(s) to understand the fundamental cause and put\nit right. While there are a number of techniques for undertaking root cause analysis, one of\nthe most common and simplest to use is the ‘five whys’ technique. The technique is based\non repeatedly digging deeper into the cause of a problem by asking ‘Why …?’ to get to the\nroot of the issue. Usually, the root cause becomes evident after five steps, but this is not\nfixed and further investigation should be completed where required. This is described in\nmore detail in the example in clause 3.7.2.\nSome clauses in the Standard specifically require root cause analysis but it is up to the site\nto establish a procedure for its completion. Root cause analysis procedures should include:\n- a set of parameters that will initiate the use of an appropriate tool (i.e. the site must define\nwhen the analysis will be completed if it is not already prescribed by the Standard)\n- who is trained and/or authorised to complete the analysis\n- the methods that the site will use to conduct the analysis\n- the records which detail the analysis and any subsequent preventive actions\n- the methods for the verification of the completed actions.\nThe auditor will expect to see a documented procedure that includes this information, as\nwell as evidence of any root cause analysis and preventive action that the site has carried\nout.\nIt is worth noting that in some geographies the analysis of trends may be a legal\nrequirement. For example, in the EU, the Microbiological Criteria for Foodstuffs (EC) No\n2073/2005 states that food business operators (FBOs) shall analyse trends in test results.\nWhen they observe a trend towards unsatisfactory results, they shall take appropriate\nactions without undue delay to remedy the situation in order to prevent the occurrence of\nmicrobiological risks.\nI\nClause\nRequirements"

However, the\noperator inadvertently uses ingredient B instead. The immediate reaction would probably be\nthat this was operator error. Although this may be accurate, it does not establish the reason\nwhy the error occurred or prevent it from happening in the future. Using the five whys\ntechnique, the root cause analysis should ask and answer a series of questions:\n- Why did the operator make the error? The operator was unfamiliar with the procedure.\n- Why was an operator who was unfamiliar with the procedure asked to complete it? He\nhad been trained but there was no supervision or sign-off of the training to confirm it was\nsatisfactory.\n- Why was the training not satisfactory? The two ingredients looked identical.\n- Why weren’t the ingredients clearly labelled? The labels had been removed during\ncleaning and not replaced.\n- Why weren’t the labels replaced? The cleaning staff did not consider the significance of\nthe delay or the potential for an error.\n- Why were the ingredient containers being used if they had not been set up correctly for\nmanufacture? Checking the labels did not form part of anyone’s duties.\nThe conclusion of a root cause analysis should be to identify what should be changed to\nprevent recurrence of the error. In this example, the conclusion might be to:\n- update the training procedure\n- introduce a training sign-off procedure to ensure training is understood\n- replace labels – if practical, with ones that cannot be removed. Where labels must be\nremoved occasionally, ensure that post-maintenance line checks include a check of\nsignage\n- ensure that an individual (e.g. the production manager) is authorised and responsible for\npost-cleaning line sign-off\n- ensure that cleaning staff fully understand and are trained in the need to return labelling\n(and all equipment) to a fully operational state.\nNow that the root cause analysis has been completed, it is easy to see how this incident\noccurred. The causes were:\n- an incomplete training procedure\n- a faulty cleaning process\n- lack of post-cleaning check procedures.\nThe next step of the process is for the site to identify and implement suitable preventive\naction to ensure the problem does not occur again (where a non-conformity has multiple\ncauses it is important that the preventive action addresses all of these). For example:\n- update the training procedure to ensure sign-off ( and possibly a supervision step)\n- replace ingredient labels ideally with ones that cannot be removed\n- if labels must occasionally be removed, ensure that post-cleaning line checks include a\nsignage check\n- ensure an individual is authorised and responsible for post-cleaning line sign-off\n- ensure cleaners fully understand and are trained in the need to return labelling (and all\nequipment) in a fully operational state.\nBRCGS has produced a guideline on root cause analysis which may be purchased from the\nBRCGS Store or viewed online at BRCGS Participate.\nI"

Products such as sugar may be delivered with clear batch\nidentification; however, if they are emptied into a single storage tank that is mixed with\nearlier deliveries, the reduction in accurate traceability is compounded by the potential\nfor product to be trapped in dead zones during filling and emptying. If a particular delivery\nis identified as being contaminated, the entire product in the storage tank would need to\nbe disposed of, as well as several lot codes of finished product, as the company would not\nbe able to identify the specific batch of finished product that contained the contaminated\nmaterial.

For example, if bulk containers are labelled,\nconsider how the information is presented to ensure it is legible and accurate. Common\nnon-conformities include the ineffective labelling of part-used packs in production, work in\nprogress, and storage areas leading to potential errors.\nStrict controls on material identification, traceability and segregation are also required to\npreserve the integrity of any claims made, such as organic status. Where logos are used that\nmake specific claims about production systems (e.g. farm assurance), full traceability must be\ndemonstrated (see also section 5.4).\nApart from batch or lot codes, traceability information will usually include date codes to\nensure that only ingredients, intermediates and products within the appropriate shelf-life\nperiod are used.

However, if there are significant\ndifferences or specific traceability challenges relating to one product or group of products,\nadditional tests specifically related to that product or group of products may be needed.\nTraceability testing may be completed as part of a real product recall or withdrawal\nscenario if one has occurred, since the objective is to test the system and identify areas for\nimprovement, rather than supply records of a ‘test’ for its own sake.\nI\nClause\nRequirements\nInterpretation\ncontinued\nThe system must provide traceability forwards and backwards; therefore the system should\nbe tested in both directions. For example, a raw material could be selected and traced\nforwards to show in which finished products it was used. A finished product should also\nbe selected and traced backwards to show all the raw material batch codes (including\nprimary packaging) that were used to produce it. The tests should include identifying\nwhich customers received the finished products and which suppliers provided the raw\nmaterials. The traceability test must also include the traceability of the primary packaging\nmaterials. Although there are many benefits to complete supply chain traceability (i.e. from\nthe farm through all stages of processing, distribution and storage, through to the retailer\nor food service company), this clause does not require sites to complete full supply chain\ntraceability tests. The scope of the traceability test required here is from the suppliers of the\nraw material, through the site’s processes, to the site’s customers.\nThe site is also expected to compile a summary of the documents that should be referenced\nduring the test, and clearly show the links between them. This is of benefit to both the\nsite and the auditor, as it ensures all relevant documents are retrieved, and explains the\ntraceability system.\nThe test of traceability should be timed and full traceability would be expected to be\nachieved within 4 hours. This is to reflect the need for rapid traceability in the event of a\nrecall. Where traceability takes longer than 4 hours, review the areas where the retrieval of\ninformation is slow in order to identify improvements.\nFor all food products, and printed packaging and labels which have product safety\ninformation, the tests must also include a quantity check or mass balance exercise. It is not\nexpected that the full mass balance exercise would always be achievable within 4 hours. The\nobjective is to be able to account for the usage of a full batch of a raw material. This helps\nto ensure that the traceability systems are capable of operating effectively should a product\nrecall be required based on the recall of an ingredient.\nThe mass balance exercise is usually undertaken as follows:\n- Select a batch code of a particular specific raw material.\n- Identify the quantity of the raw material supplied under that batch code.\n- Identify the recipes in which the ingredient is used.\n- Use production schedules and batch make-up sheets to calculate the quantities of the\nselected batch of ingredient used in each product.\n- Calculate the quantity of any unused part of the batch in the warehouse.\n- Reconcile the quantity delivered against the amounts used plus any residual unused stock.\nIn some instances quantity checks may take a great deal of time and resource to complete\nsuccessfully.\nIt is unlikely that the mass balance exercise will be able to account for all materials to\n100% accuracy. However, the company needs to justify any discrepancies and demonstrate\nunderstanding of the nature of the variance. This may be inherent in the product\ncharacteristics (e.g. dehydration of fresh ingredients), or be ascribed to typical wastage on\nequipment or portion variances. Where the site adds subsequent deliveries to a bulk silo,\nthe test should clearly show how this has been managed. The principle is to ensure that\nthe traceability system is effective. Mass balance is a key measure of its workability and\nhighlights areas for improvement.\n110 brcgs.com\nClause\nRequirements\nInterpretation\ncontinued\nDuring the BRCGS audit, the auditor will ask the site to complete at least one ‘vertical’ audit.\nAt a minimum this will include the traceability of a specific batch of product or ingredient\nthrough the site’s production, processing and distribution processes, and a review of the\nsite records related to the product or ingredient. Records will include, for example, supplier\napproval, goods receipt, process records (such as temperature monitoring), metal detector\nchecks and dispatch records.\nHowever, the vertical audit is not expected to include records that would only be held at\nother points in the supply chain (e.g. the raw material supplier’s processing records). This\nvertical audit is in addition to the review of the site’s own traceability tests. The final audit\nreport will include a summary of the vertical audit results.\nThe vertical audit will also include a mass balance exercise and a review of the systems\nrelating to the accuracy of labelling (clause 5.2.1). Further information on the content of\nthe audit, including the vertical audit, can be obtained from BRCGS’ auditing techniques\ndocument.

The main risks to\nconsider are: the carry-over of boiler water-treatment chemicals in steam; dust particles in\ncompressed air; and oil used as a lubricant in compressed-air systems.\nThe level of monitoring needs to be based on an assessment of potential risk.

The gauge of filtration (e.g.\nmesh size) and frequency of checks should be documented and based on risk assessment,\ntaking into account the source of the air, the type of compressors used and the condition\nof the pipework (e.g. evidence of corrosion). The compressor suppliers or experts should\nbe consulted to establish any potential risks and any necessary testing. The objective of\nusing filters is to prevent dust particles and lubricating oil from the compression system\ncontaminating the products. Therefore a single central filter, in close proximity to the\ncompressor, but remote from the food-related use of the compressed air, is unlikely to\nprovide sufficient product protection. The site must be able to justify the effectiveness of\nthe filtration system employed.\nIf gases are used, such as in modified atmosphere packing, they must be demonstrated\nas being of an appropriate quality.

For\nexample, a simple plastic scoop is only likely to need a very simple set of user requirements,\nwith minimal food hazards identified, whereas a new production line is likely to require\nsignificantly more details regarding, for example, product types, production rates and food\ncontact requirements.\nPurchase specifications usually include:\n- reference to any relevant legislation\n- requirements for food contact surfaces (i.e. where product will be in contact with the\nequipment)\n- intended use of the equipment\n- types of materials that will be used (this is particularly important for food contact surfaces,\nsince potential migration from equipment may be affected by the composition of the food\nmaterial, e.g. high fat or acidic materials can increase potential for migration).\nGood practice is to consider who within the company can authorise the purchase of\nnew equipment. For re-purchases of simple equipment, this may be simply a case of\nidentifying who is authorised to order the product; however, for complex machinery (such\nas a new production line), there may need to be input from multiple departments, such as\nengineering, technical, hygiene and finance.

For example, in some operations (e.g.\nsites manufacturing a product with an allergen-free claim), specific allergens may present a\nparticular risk. These sites should specify any relevant company policies to confectionery\nvending suppliers and catering facilities.\nAt the BRCGS audit, there will be a basic inspection of the kitchen facilities.

(The list could also detail the\nfrequency with which the items must be checked.)\n- recorded, routine inspections to verify the condition of these items. Inspections must be\ncarried out at a specified frequency based on risk assessment; some areas may be checked\nmore frequently than others because of their potential to form a foreign-body hazard\nin the product. (For example, a factory identifies part of the production line which has\nplastic-laminated line covers that may chip or break. The condition of this section of the\nline is specifically checked daily prior to production, because it is above open food and\nany breakage or damage is likely to result in a foreign-body issue.

The objective is\nto create a list of items that represent a real risk of breakage and product contamination.\nFor example, the window above the production line is likely to be high-risk, as any breakage\nis likely to contaminate the product. But the window in the Director’s office, on the other\nside of the site, does not need to be included unless there is a genuine risk of product\ncontamination if the window breaks.\nI\nClause\nRequirements\nFurther guidance\ncontinued\nThe frequency of the inspections must be based on risk assessment. The quality of the\nrisk assessment is important as some items will probably be checked infrequently because\nof their lower risk status, whereas others may require frequent checks because of their\nprominent location and associated risk. For example, checking the window above the\nproduction line is likely to form part of the daily line start-up procedures.\nYou must ensure you have a contingency procedure in place that allows the reporting and\ntimely management of any breakage (i.e. if an item is found to be damaged or broken during\nan inspection or if an item breaks during use).\nThere are a number of risk assessment techniques that can be used within food sites and\nthe Standard is not prescriptive about which should be selected. However, there are two key\nconsiderations in relation to glass and brittle materials:\n- the potential for damage or breakage\n- the location and consequently the likelihood of a broken fragment contaminating a food\nproduct.\nThe importance of good documentation and record-keeping\nFive key documents are required:\n- a list of items giving details of their location, number, type and condition\n- a risk assessment defining the required frequency of checks\n- records of the routine inspections to verify the condition of these items (see examples in\nFigures 16 and 17)\n- procedures that allow the cleaning or replacement of items in a way that minimises\npotential risk to products\n- a procedure for the management of any breakages (see clause 4.9.3.3).\nA record of the checks must be maintained even when there is no change to the status of\nthe item (see examples in Figure 16 and 17). This is to demonstrate that the checks were\nmade, so that in the event of a breakage you can be confident that the item was intact at the\nprevious scheduled inspection, allowing any investigation or action to focus on a defined\ntime period.\nExamples\nITEM\nLOCATION\nNUMBER\nTYPE\nCONDITION\nFREQUENCY OF\nINSPECTION\n(REFER TO RISK\nASSESSMENT\nFOR FULL\nDETAILS)\nWindows\nProduction"

In the majority of sites, good practice would normally\ninclude six stages of cleaning:\n- remove gross debris (e.g. sweep or wipe)\n- rinse with water\n- wash with detergent solution using hot water\n- rinse\n- dry\n- sanitise.\nWhere equipment requires different levels of cleaning (e.g. between products, or between\ndaily and weekly cleans), each requirement should be clearly detailed and specific to the\nitem of equipment. These procedures need to be reviewed and updated whenever changes\nto the equipment and areas to be cleaned occur.\nIn addition, a good cleaning instruction would include:\n- a unique method of reference that can be quoted on paperwork (e.g. cleaning records)\n- photographs of equipment, which are useful for identifying equipment and for highlighting\nareas that are difficult to clean, or that form key check/verification points\n- the appropriate protective clothing or equipment that should be worn when cleaning or\nhandling cleaning chemicals.\n174 brcgs.com\nClause\nRequirements\nFurther guidance\nDeveloping an effective cleaning procedure\nIn order for cleaning to be effective, it is important that the procedures are designed for the\nspecific item, area or site. A generic, off-the-shelf procedure probably would not guarantee\na sufficient standard of cleaning. For example, an identical work surface in an area handling\nbakery products would need to be treated differently from one in a meat-handling area.\nThis would need to be assessed during the development and risk assessment stage. The\ncomplexity of the process and equipment, the types of product manufactured, the ease with\nwhich debris can be removed, and the need to manage specific hazards (e.g. specific microorganisms or allergens) are also factors to consider.\nDeveloping a cleaning procedure can be done in a few simple steps:\n- Step 1 Set the required standard of cleaning (clause 4.11.3)\nConsider legislation, customer requirements, industry or category best practice, etc. The\nrisk assessment should consider the prevention of contamination from previous products,\nas well as address potential microbiological, chemical or allergen concerns.\n- Step 2 Develop draft procedures (clause 4.11.2)\nEnsure all items, areas and equipment are defined and included within the procedures.\nThink about the order of cleaning too, so that cleaned equipment is not re-contaminated\nby subsequent cleaning activity.\n- Step 3 Validate the draft procedures (clause 4.11.3)\nUse validation to confirm that the required standard of cleaning (Step 1) is met. The\nStandard requires that cleaning procedures which form part of a defined prerequisite\n(i.e. procedures that are used to control a specific hazard such as allergen crosscontamination) must be validated to ensure they are effective and deliver the intended\nlevel of cleaning. However, it is also good practice for all cleaning procedures to be\nvalidated.\n- Step 4 Finalise procedures and associated documentation (e.g. cleaning records and signoff)\nKeep records that show what type of cleaning was completed, when it was completed,\nwho did it, and who checked the cleaning and signed it off as acceptable (a requirement of\nclause 4.11.2).\n- Step 5 Train relevant staff (clause 4.11.4).\n- Step 6 Complete ongoing monitoring and verification (clauses 4.11.2 and 4.11.5).\nWhen developing cleaning procedures, it is often useful to remember:\n- All equipment and areas must be included.\n- Cleaning needs should be discussed with equipment and chemical suppliers, who can\noften provide valuable assistance in identifying suitable cleaning materials.\n- Validation and verification are needed for cleaning activities – validation before\nintroducing the new procedure, and verification on an ongoing basis. Verification is the\napplication of checks or tests, at regular intervals, to ensure the cleaning procedure is still\nworking and continues to deliver the required level of cleaning. Verification of cleaning\nmay include internal audits, record reviews, swabs or tests of the cleaned equipment,\nand the assessment of staff to ensure they have a clear understanding of the cleaning\nprocedure.\nI\nClause\nRequirements\nFurther guidance\ncontinued\n- Cleaning procedures should be reviewed whenever there are changes to the area,\nequipment or processes, including the introduction of new products or the use of new\ningredients.\nExample of a\ncleaning record\nIn addition to cleaning procedures, the Standard also requires records of the cleaning\ncompleted. As shown in Figure 19, records for routine cleaning generally include:\n- what was cleaned\n- who completed the cleaning\n- when the cleaning was completed\n- monitoring, sign-off or confirmation that appropriate cleaning has been completed to a\nsatisfactory standard.\nMON\nTUE\nWED\nTHU\nFRI\nSAT\nSUN\nMETHOD\nEQUIPMENT/\nAREA\nFREQUENCY\nClean\nSign\nCheck\nSign\nClean\nSign\nCheck\nSign\nClean\nSign\nCheck\nSign\nClean\nSign\nCheck\nSign\nClean\nSign\nCheck\nSign\nClean\nSign\nCheck\nSign\nClean\nSign\nCheck\nSign\nA1\nConveyor 1\nDaily\nA1\nA2 Bowl Mixer 1\nDaily\nA1\nA2 Bowl Mixer 2\nDaily\nA1\nA3 Spiral Chiller\nDaily\nSITE AREA: Production\nWEEK COMMENCING:\nDOCUMENT REFERENCE\nISSUE DATE/VERSION NUMBER\nISSUE/AUTHORISED BY\nFigure 19 Example of a cleaning record"

Suitable techniques include pathogen modelling, challenge testing and published literature from a reputable\nsource demonstrating that pathogens cannot survive or grow.\nExamples of products where risk assessment may establish that environmental monitoring is not required include:\n- alcoholic beverages and vinegars with a sufficiently high level of alcohol or acid to prevent survival and growth\n- salt and sugar in their dry ‘pure’ form\n- edible oils with no added ingredients\n- fully enclosed production. For example, at a specialist HPP (high-pressure processing) facility, where product is\nreceived packed, is processed in its packaging and leaves the site in the same packaging\n- whole vegetables, sold unwashed.\nAuditors will challenge the basis of any risk assessment to make sure this has properly considered likely issues and is\ndemonstrably based on robust science.\nThe requirements for environmental monitoring indicate that the site’s environmental monitoring programme must\nbe risk-based, therefore the food safety plan/HACCP may indicate risks that should be monitored. Risks may include\npathogens and/or spoilage organisms (such as yeasts or moulds), and the site should consider whether it is more\nsuitable to monitor the risk directly or via indicator organisms. Well-known examples of pathogens and spoilage\norganisms that may be applicable to a site’s environmental monitoring include:\n- Listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat products, including those which are chilled and frozen. Alternatively, some\nsites monitor Listeria spp. and only examine the species if adverse positive results are obtained\n- Salmonella and/or Enterobacteriaceae in dry environments where susceptible products are handled\n- yeasts and/or moulds: these are widespread spoilage organisms which may be of greater relevance for some\nproduct types. For example, products such as jam are heated to a temperature that will kill many bacterial\ncontaminants, are hot-filled, and have a low water activity and low oxygen content. Consequently, the risk of\npathogen growth is limited. However, there are yeasts and moulds that can cause spoilage in these conditions, and\ntherefore manufacturers must ensure that packaging, food contact surfaces and the environment are monitored to\nminimise the risk of contamination.\nClause\nRequirements"

    "interpretation_guidance": "Vulnerability assessment\nA vulnerability assessment is a search for potential weaknesses in the supply chain in order\nto prevent food fraud (i.e. to prevent the adulteration or substitution of raw materials before\nthey arrive at the site). It is a specialised form of risk assessment, and needs a systematic and\nstructured approach to ensure data gathering, identification of significant food fraud hazards,\nassessment of likelihood of occurrence, and identification and implementation of controls\nto mitigate genuine risks. The aim of the assessment is not to assess the potential for fraud\nat the site, but to examine the supply chain for potential concerns or weaknesses, thereby\nidentifying those raw materials that are at particular risk of adulteration or substitution, so\nthat appropriate controls can be put in place (clause 5.4.4).\nThe vulnerability assessment will consider information relating to each ingredient in order\nto assess whether there is a potential for food fraud. Where a site purchases a number of\nsimilar raw materials, it may be possible to consider these as a group rather than each raw\nmaterial individually, providing the risks are similar. The company will need to ensure that all\nfood materials are subject to a vulnerability assessment.\nTypical information to incorporate into the assessment includes:\n- any emerging issues and information identified in clause 5.4.2\n- historical evidence of substitution or adulteration of the ingredient\n- cost/value of the material\n- availability (e.g. a poor harvest may restrict availability and may increase the potential for\nadulteration)\n- sophistication of routine testing to identify adulterants. If testing within the supply chain\nis comprehensive and specifically focused on potential fraud issues, then the likelihood\nof adulteration is reduced (e.g. fruit juice is often tested for a comprehensive range of\nparameters, including DNA, isotopic analysis, added sugars and added water to prevent\npotential fraud)\nI\nClause\nRequirements\nInterpretation\ncontinued\n- country of origin\n- length and complexity of the supply chain\n- supply chain model\n- controls that are already in the supply chain. For example, if the raw material supplier\nis certificated to the Standard, then as part of that certification the supplier must have\ncompleted its own vulnerability assessment, and there is no requirement in the Standard\nfor the site to duplicate its supplier’s vulnerability assessment.\nThe nature of the raw material may change the potential for food fraud. For example, if a\nslaughterhouse is purchasing cattle, horses and pigs for slaughter, it will be obvious if there\nis an issue with the live animals; however, if the slaughterhouse intends to make a claim\nsuch as organic, Aberdeen Angus or specified country of origin, then greater controls of\nraw materials will be required to ensure only those which meet the claim are purchased.\nSimilarly, prepared ingredients such as beef mince or ground spices are likely to have a\ngreater risk than the whole ingredient.\nThe Standard does not define the exact process that the site must follow when completing\nthe vulnerability assessment; however, it is likely to incorporate the following steps:\n- draw up a list of raw materials (or groups of raw materials) and the controls (e.g. product\ntesting, traceability systems or supply chain audits) that are already in operation\n- consider the information obtained from clause 5.4.2 for each ingredient\n- complete a risk assessment on the vulnerability of each ingredient.\nNote that the Standard does not require full supply chain mapping for all raw materials,\nalthough this may be a useful tool where a risk assessment indicates that a genuine risk\nexists and there is a need to identify the point in the supply chain where an effective control\ncan be applied.\nThe output of the vulnerability assessment must include a documented vulnerability\nassessment plan which should rank or score the materials to identify those which need\nadditional controls. The ranking and actions required could, for example, be as follows:\n- Very high A high-profile raw material with recent reports of adulteration published by\nregulatory authorities. Action or monitoring is required to ensure only genuine materials\nare purchased\n- High A high-profile material that provides an attractive target for potential adulteration.\nSome action and/or monitoring is required to ensure only genuine materials are purchased\n- Low This material is unlikely to be a target for substitution or adulteration; however a reassessment may be necessary if new information becomes available\n- Negligible No further action required as the material is extremely unlikely to be a target\nfor food fraud.\nAs mentioned earlier in this interpretation, situations relating to food fraud change, and it\nis therefore important that the company has a dynamic system that can react to and assess\nnew information as it becomes available, thereby ensuring the vulnerability assessment\nremains up to date. At a minimum, the vulnerability assessment must be reviewed at least\nannually and when there is a significant change to the ingredient. As a guide, a review may be\ntriggered by the following, although this is not an exhaustive list:\n220 brcgs.com\nClause\nRequirements\nInterpretation\ncontinued\n- a change in the country of origin or the supplier of raw materials\n- a change in the financial situation of raw material suppliers or countries of origin\n- a change in cost of raw materials, either upwards or downwards\n- a change in the supply chain, logistics and delivery of materials\n- a change in material availability (e.g. because of seasonal shortages)\n- emergence of a new risk (e.g. known adulteration of an ingredient)\n- developments in scientific information associated with ingredients, process or product\n- information received as part of a supplier approval or raw material risk assessment (e.g.\nclause 3.5.1.1) which highlights new or evolving risks.\nA number of risk assessment tools have been published. These include some specialist\nvulnerability assessment tools such as CARVER + Shock and TACCP (threat assessment\nand critical control points), which may be used to achieve a structured approach to the\nassessment process.\nBRCGS has published a number of items to assist with vulnerability assessments. These\ninclude a specific vulnerability assessment guideline that can be obtained from the\nBRCGS Store or viewed online at BRCGS Participate, and a training course available through\nBRCGS Performance Enhancement and its global network of approved training providers.\nA number of organisations have produced tools to assist with food fraud and vulnerability\nassessments, including, for example, the Food Fraud Resilience Self-Assessment Tool\navailable on the UK FSA website."

For example, in the EU the site may decide that it needs\nto review an EU Declaration of Compliance (DoC) for Food Contact Materials due to a\nperceived risk of migration.\nThe site would need to demonstrate that the evidence available is appropriate for the\nlevel of risk associated with the packaging – it would not be acceptable to list the clause\nas ‘not applicable’, as there should also be evidence that the matter has been adequately\ncommunicated/discussed with the packaging supplier.\nBRCGS has published a guideline on migration from packaging materials into food, which\nmay be purchased from the BRCGS Store or viewed online at BRCGS Participate."

It is defined as the range of the\nvalues that could reasonably be expected for the attribute (e.g. the micro-organism, allergen\nor chemical) being measured. It is sometimes known as the ‘margin of doubt’ of the result.\nMeasurement uncertainty is important when making conformity decisions (i.e. assessing\nwhether a test result is within legal, safety or acceptable limits), as the range of probable\nvalues may cross one of these limits.\nNo matter what method is used, it will be subject to challenges inherent in taking the\nmeasurements accurately, day-to-day variations (e.g. in equipment, reagents, personnel\nor environmental conditions), and any systematic errors, random errors or corrections\nassociated with the test; therefore the result obtained is the best estimate of the value.\nRandom errors are errors that fluctuate due to the unpredictability or uncertainty inherent\nin the measuring process, or the variation in the quantity being measured (i.e. variation\nthroughout the sample or product being tested, and this is often demonstrated by the\nnormal variation seen in replicate measurements of the same material). A systematic\nerror is one that originates from a persistent issue and leads to a consistent error in the\nmeasurements; for example, recovery.\nI\nClause\nRequirements\nMeasurement\nuncertainty\ncontinued\nProduct testing is often completed to establish compliance with limits; i.e. to demonstrate\nthat a product meets the requirements defined in its specification, by regulations and\nby customers. Knowing the measurement uncertainty is important when making these\nconformity decisions. For illustrative purposes only, in Figure 20, the horizontal line\nrepresents the target value or limit; values above this fall outside the permitted range, and\nvalues below it are within the permitted range.\nA\nB\nC\nD\nFigure 20 Example of the possible effects of measurement uncertainty\nResults A and D are well above or well below the limit, and thus applying the measurement\nuncertainty value will not change the conformity statement made (e.g. A is still outside the\nlimit and D is still in specification). It is in results B and C where measurement uncertainty\nwould impact on the conformity.\nThe value obtained for C is within the limit. However, if the result and measurement\nuncertainty are combined, the value represented by C may fall above the limit and thus be\nout of specification.\nThe value obtained for B is above the limit and therefore would be out of specification, but\ntaking measurement uncertainty into consideration, there is a potential that B could fall\nbelow the threshold (i.e. be within specification).\nApplying measurement uncertainty in this manner needs careful consideration and\njustification depending on the risk, applicable legislation or customer requirements. Where\nthe test is of a critical parameter (e.g. product safety or legality), measurement uncertainty\nmust not be used to prevent taking the correct action to protect consumers and/or maintain\nlegality."

If it is not possible to make adjustments to eliminate\nthese cold spots, the areas should be used as the worst-case scenarios when completing\nheat-distribution studies\n- temperature distribution in freezers and cold stores – when assessing whether to\nundertake temperature distribution studies on chill or freezer facilities, the level of\nrisk will depend on the product, the time spent in store and any margin allowed by the\ntemperature settings (e.g. setting the temperature at −20°C to ensure achievement of\n−18°C). Temperature distribution studies would not normally be necessary for small chill\nor cold stores where product is stored only for short periods.\nHowever, this is not a prescriptive list, and the site should consider all situations where\nvariations in processing conditions may occur in equipment critical to the safety or quality\nof products. For example, if pH is identified as critical, it may be necessary to validate the\npH distribution in a mixing vessel, and consider the thoroughness of the mixing process to\nachieve the desired pH throughout the batch.\nWhen testing equipment, any seasonal variations in performance must be considered,\nespecially when trying to assess worst-case scenarios. For example, a chiller evaluated\nin winter may not give the same results in summer, especially if there are large seasonal\ndifferences in the ambient temperatures. Some refrigeration equipment may be at the\nlimit of their performance on especially hot days if temperature parameters have not been\nproperly specified."

However, a\nnumber of studies have shown that people either do not wash their hands or fail to clean\nthem effectively. So it is vital that food companies not only provide staff with appropriate\nfacilities to wash their hands but also ensure staff are aware of the correct procedure to\nfollow.\nWhat makes a good hand-washing procedure?\nFrequency\nHand-washing should be carried out as often as is appropriate for the level of risk to the\nproduct. At a minimum hands should be washed:\n- before entering production areas\n- after any break which involves leaving the production area\n- after going to the toilet\n- after eating or smoking\n- after blowing your nose.\nSee also clause 8.4.1 for hand-washing facilities and procedures in high-risk and high-care\nzones.\nMethod\nThere are a number of steps in an effective hand-washing procedure:\n- wet hands with water\n- apply soap\n- rub the hands so that all the parts of the hands are cleaned, including palms, backs of\nhands, between fingers, backs of fingers, thumbs and fingertips\n- rinse hands to remove soap\n- dry hands thoroughly, as careful drying is a vital step in preventing the contamination of\nfood products.\nFor a pictorial example of best practice for hand-washing, visit the World Health\nOrganization’s ‘How to Handwash?’ page.\nIn addition to the above routine, good practice is to apply a sanitiser such as an antibacterial hand gel after the hands have been washed and dried. An effective hand-washing\nroutine should take approximately 40–60 seconds to complete.\nTraining\nIt is important that a good hygiene culture operates within the site so that an effective\nhand-washing routine becomes normal, everyday behaviour. This means that all new staff\nshould be trained (e.g. during induction training) in the site’s hand-cleaning procedures\nand understand the importance of them. Regular updates can help ensure the information\nremains fresh in people’s minds.\nFacilities\nFor a description of hand-washing facilities, see the guidance for clause 4.8.4.\n260 brcgs.com\nClause\nRequirements"

For example, home laundering would not be permitted in bakeries\nbecause although the protective clothing is being used in a low-risk area, it is an open\nproduct area where the clothing is needed to protect the product, not the employee.\nHome laundering still requires appropriate care and attention to ensure that potential\npathogens are removed or killed. Therefore, where approved, home laundering needs to be\ncontrolled by written instructions, including, for example:\n- how garments are to be washed (temperature, detergent, specifying items not to be\nwashed together, and drying instructions such as the use of a hot iron to further heatdisinfect the clothes)\n- procedures for transporting clean protective clothing to the workplace; for example,\nprovision of sealable plastic bags or similar, which allow washed garments to be\ntransported from home to the workplace without becoming contaminated\n- on-site procedures; for example, defined responsibility within the company for monitoring\nthe effectiveness of the system (typically achieved by visual inspection). There must\nalso be a procedure and system for effectively dealing with any case where employees\nare unable to perform self-laundry, either through lack of diligence or through lack of\nfacilities.

The Standard defines\nthese areas as production risk zones.\nThe main principle of the production risk zones in the Standard is to ensure that the environmental conditions\nand controls in open product areas are appropriate for the products being handled. Therefore the expectations for\nfactory hygiene, finish of buildings, equipment, protective clothing and staff hygiene should reflect the potential\nrisks to the product.\nWhere a site produces products that require handling in high-risk, high-care and/or ambient high-care production\nfacilities (see Appendix 2 of the Standard for the definition of products that require these facilities), equivalent\ncontrols are expected for any subsequent handling or re-packing operation where the product is open to the factory\nenvironment (i.e. the re-packing site is expected to have equivalent facilities).\nBRCGS has produced a specific guideline on high risk, high care and ambient high care, which explains the\nrequirements and provides details of good practice.

The purpose of the physical segregation is to provide a\nself-contained area where uncovered (i.e. unprotected) high-risk products are handled after\nthe microbiological kill step (e.g. heat treatment or cooking) until they are fully protected,\nusually by means of final packaging. The segregating barrier must be capable of minimising\nthe risk of cross-contamination from:\n- pathogens which may be present in a low-risk environment or on products or ingredients\nthat have not received a full cook\n- all people moving between the high-risk area and other areas, except through designated\nchanging areas\n- the movement of all equipment, cleaning chemicals, utensils or materials into the high-risk\narea, except through designated ports with sanitising controls in place\n- water or other liquids (e.g. cleaning chemicals) on the floor, washing into the high-risk area\n- airborne contaminants (e.g. dust particles or water droplets).\nI\nClause\nRequirements\nInterpretation\ncontinued\nThe ideal barrier is a full wall (e.g. a separate room) separating the high-risk area from other\nareas. In assessing the suitability of a segregating barrier, a risk assessment should be carried\nout and documented.\nTime segregation is not an acceptable alternative for high-risk areas, except for the transfer\nareas noted below. The location and operation of all transfer points must not compromise\nhigh-risk and low-risk segregation. For example, where raw materials or staff move into a\nhigh-risk area, consideration must be given to whether this introduces a contamination\nhazard; it may therefore require measures that involve:\n- use of disinfection\n- removal of outer packaging\n- double-door ovens, blast chillers or freezers (i.e. those with a separate entrance and exit)\n- controlled air flow (clause 8.2.2)\n- changing the design of entrances and exits (e.g. roller lifting doors may represent a risk\nwhen raised, due to the fact they have been in contact with the floor and the difficulty in\ncleaning them effectively).\nHigh-risk areas are expected to be self-contained and fully segregated. Best practice is that,\nwhere there is a cook step in the production of high-risk products, the cooker becomes\nthe transfer point into the high-risk area via a double-door system (i.e. the cooker is loaded\nin the low-risk area and unloaded directly into the high-risk area). While new cooker\ninstallations and new-build sites must incorporate double-door cooking systems, many\nexisting plants are equipped with single-door cookers and have established risk-based\nprocedures for the loading and unloading of the cookers to prevent cross-contamination\nof cooked products. The Standard will, therefore, accept the use of single-door cooking\nsystems where a thorough risk assessment has been completed as an interim measure\nprior to the eventual upgrading. Operating practices must be consistently achievable and\neffective, and prevent cross-contamination of cooked products.\nThe risk assessment must consider, and control potential risk, from:\n- crossover between cooked and raw products in the unloading area\n- operators and their clothing (e.g. handling of cooked products by operators who have\npreviously worked with raw products)\n- hand-contamination resulting from touching surfaces such as common equipment, cooker\ncontrol panels and cooker door handles\n- equipment used for transferring product into and out of cookers\n- airborne contamination from low-risk processes (e.g. the loading and unloading area\nshould be separate from the main low-risk processing area)\n- the floor (e.g. contamination of the wheels of trolleys transferring cooked products to the\nhigh-risk area).\nWhen cooked products are unloaded from the cooker, they must be moved immediately\nto a designated high-risk area to meet the requirements of the Standard. The auditor will\nassess the procedures in operation where single-door cookers are in use to ensure they\nare adequate, effective and understood by operators. The audit report will describe the\nprocedures in place to protect the cooked products from contamination.\nHigh-risk areas contain only components and foods which have undergone a cook or similar\nprocess to achieve, typically, a 6-log reduction for Listeria. Where a single area includes, by\nnecessity, some components which have received a lesser kill, together with fully cooked\ncomponents (e.g. in a sandwich preparation area), this will be classed as high care.\n270 brcgs.com\nClause\nRequirements\nExample\nCooked crustacea – a product requiring a high-risk production zone\nWhere crustacea are cooked as part of the production process, or were cooked at an earlier\nstep in the production process (including at another site), the site will need to ensure the\ncorrect production risk zones are used.\nAccording to the definitions in Appendix 2 of the Standard, cooked crustacea fit into the\ndefinition of a product requiring a high-risk production zone because:\n- finished product is chilled or frozen to preserve food safety\n- all components have received a full cook (equivalent to a 6 log reduction in Listeria\nmonocytogenes)\n- finished product is vulnerable to growth of pathogens or survival of pathogens that could\nsubsequently grow during normal storage and use\n- finished product is ready to eat or ready to heat or, on the basis of known consumer use, is\nlikely to be eaten without adequate cooking.\nAlthough the Standard recognises that some food products can be effectively managed\nusing consumer cooking instructions, these instructions are not considered a valid\njustification for using a different production zone for cooked crustacea, as known consumer\nuse in many countries is to eat the product cold without any heating, and therefore without\na full cook by the consumer. Furthermore, the product appearance could lead consumers to\nbelieve the product is already fully cooked, and that no additional cooking is required.\nWhere a site is partially heating a crustacean (i.e. less than a 6-log reduction in Listeria\nmonocytogenes), a high-care area will be appropriate."
