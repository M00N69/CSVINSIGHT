    "interpretation_guidance": "Documented policy The site’s policy must clearly state the overall aims to meet customer requirements, including the\nprovision of safe, authentic products of the quality desired by the customer. The policy will also highlight the site’s\nintention to improve product safety and quality culture on a continuous basis, which, as discussed (for example, in the\ninterpretation for the statement of intent and importantly in clause 1.1.2), is fundamental in the consistent\napplication of product safety practices. The policy is designed to show the site’s intention, so that all staff can\nwork towards this common goal. Authenticity of products means ensuring that all products sold or purchased are of the\nnature, substance and quality expected. This applies not just to product claims, but includes all products and raw\nmaterials with the assurance that they meet the specification. Authenticity is defined in the glossary. The policy must\nbe signed by the person with overall responsibility for the audited site, to demonstrate the commitment at senior\nmanagement at site level. Where the policy is a group- or company-wide statement, the site management should endorse\nit; for example, by countersigning it. The policy statement is only a summary and can usually be expressed in a single\npage. Although it does not need to be dated, it must be current and should therefore be updated when significant\npolicies or senior management change. The policy forms the foundation for the site’s ways of working and the auditor\nwill expect to see how the site management ensure staff understanding and engagement. This may include: - communication\nto staff (e.g. through display on noticeboards, inclusion in the induction process, availability on the company\nintranet, and the use of appropriate languages where the local language is not the first language of all employees. The\nuse of dual languages may improve and speed up understanding and action) - inclusion of all staff, including temporary\nand contract staff, in the communication and engagement processes."

The plan shall be reviewed and updated at least annually, at a minimum.",
    "interpretation_guidance": "Food safety and quality culture Analysis of the root causes of many non-conformities shows that a proactive, positive\nproduct safety and quality culture (hereafter referred to as culture) within a company can make all the difference in\nthe effectiveness of the food safety and quality plan and its consistent implementation throughout the site. Culture\nmust be led by senior management and ‘felt’ throughout the organisation, so that all aspects of the business are\ninformed and involved. It is important to understand that the culture plan is unlikely to be successful if it is viewed\nas simply a technical function. It will require the input and commitment of the site’s senior leadership team and may\nalso align with several teams around the business; for example, with human resources (HR) or personnel management\nactivities. Culture can be challenging. It relies not just on measurables and specifics but an ethos and values felt by\npeople at all levels of the site. The size and complexity (or simplicity) of the site should not be a barrier to a\nsuccessful culture. The site is required to develop, implement and maintain a clear plan or programme for developing\nand improving its culture. Such a plan should be based on the nature of the organisation, and dependent on its size,\nseasonality and the overall aims it has identified as important for its own culture. The clause does not prescribe the\nexact mechanisms that must be used; this is to allow the site flexibility to develop systems that are effective within\nits specific ways of working, and its current prevailing culture. It does, however, highlight the minimum scope of the\nplan. The plan will need to consider the measures needed to achieve the intended positive culture change. 20 brcgs.com\nClause Requirements Interpretation continued The plan does not need to be annual. A strategic plan could, for example,\ncover 5 years, with activities designed to measure current culture, implement changes and assess improvements (or where\nimprovement was not evident, a review of why). Some aspects of the plan may occur more frequently than others. However,\nfor the plan to be effective, the development and improvement of culture will need to be treated as an ongoing and\ncontinuous process, and the auditor will expect to see evidence that activities are being completed each year during\nwhich the plan is designed to operate. It is not acceptable to design a 5-year plan where all of the activities are\ncompleted within the final year. Regardless of the intended length or lifetime of the plan, it is important that it\nremains relevant and up to date. The site will therefore need to ensure that it is regularly reviewed and updated. At a\nminimum there must be an annual review. A wide range of activities could be incorporated into a culture development\nplan, some of which the company may already be conducting. As a minimum the Standard requires: - a clear and open\ncommunication on product safety - training - feedback from employees - behaviour changes required to maintain and\nimprove product safety processes - performance measurement on product safety, authenticity, legality and quality\nrelated activities. However, note that culture is not simply a matter of introducing another policy, but on developing\nattitudes and a positive approach to product safety and product safety processes. For example: - Ease of movement of\nproduct safety information between different levels and sections of the site can be an indication of a good culture.\nHowever, a formal communication policy is not likely to affect company culture, unless the site has considered what is\ncommunicated, in what format. For example, if all communication is finance-related and lacks information on product\nsafety, then staff may mistakenly believe that product safety is not important, due to its lack of communication.\nInstead, regular, open and clear communication, involving all personnel, is needed, including expectations, benefits,\nproduct safety successes as well as deviations from what is expected or acceptable. - Training and staff development\n(e.g. the use of annual staff reviews and one-to-ones) should have a number of aims beyond just training the process or\nprocedure (e.g. awareness of food safety issues, management techniques, and development of positive behaviours and\nstaff development). - Feedback from employees (e.g. staff surveys), focusing on values and culture, can provide useful\ninformation on current mindset and culture, impact of recent initiatives and preferred direction of travel. Feedback\nmechanisms also provide an opportunity to identify and address staff concerns. Interpretation - Consideration of the\nbehaviour changes needed to improve culture – the site should choose relevant behaviours that will have a positive\nimpact on product safety. These relevant behaviours may be identified simply by a manager’s knowledge of the site, or\nidentified through the results of a site survey (such as the BRCGS Culture Excellence Module), or by considering the\nmany indicators (or artefacts) of the behaviours, beliefs or attitudes that exist at a site. These can provide an\nindication of the prevailing culture and could be used in this part of the plan. An artefact of culture is described as\nan existing product safety activity that is not culture itself, but is indicative of the site’s prevailing culture\n(i.e. the site’s attitudes towards the value or importance of a specific product safety activity, and its compliance\nwith that activity, is often indicative of the culture of the site). These behaviours or attitudes are often\nidentifiable by the site and useful in the maintenance and improvement of product safety culture and can therefore be\nbuilt into the culture improvement plan. Many fundamental product safety processes could be considered artefacts of the\nculture; for example: - food safety policy - objective setting and management review - food safety in management\nmeetings - food safety resources - risk awareness (e.g. for HACCP development) - effectiveness of corrective and\npreventive actions - internal audits - training. Remember that these activities are not the culture themselves; they\nare artefacts – indicators of the prevalent product safety behaviours at the site. - Performance measurement – this is\ndifferent from clause 1.1.3. There, the objectives are used to directly improve food safety, whereas the aim of this\nclause is to consider the impact of the results and learnings on product safety culture. For example, if an objective\nis always met, or always missed, or the objective remains unchanged every year, this may indicate a site attitude\ntowards the objectives and provides site leadership with an attitude to focus on. In other words, is the site attitude\nto develop and continuously improve food safety using the objectives as one of the tools, or are the objectives set\nonly to meet the requirements of the Standard? Along with the activities, the culture plan must also include\ninformation indicating how activities will be undertaken, the intended timescales for completion, plans for measurement\n(including results from previous activities) and a review of the effectiveness of completed activities. This\ninformation should be used to review the plan to ensure it remains up to date and relevant for the site. It also has\nthe bonus of creating a history of improvements and impacts. This information can be used, for example, to train new\nemployees, inspire existing staff and further inform the types of activity/implementation that are most effective at\nthe site and those which are more likely to struggle. Culture is often considered to be subjective and therefore\ndifficult to audit. It must be emphasised that auditors are not expected to audit ‘food safety culture’ of the site,\nbut the evidence of compliance with the requirements of the clause. The auditor will therefore examine evidence of\nconformity with this requirement during both the audit of the facilities and the documentation audit. This will be\nachieved using a number of auditing techniques; for example: 22 brcgs.com Clause Requirements Interpretation continued\n- a review of the documented plan and records – is it complete, does it contain all the relevant information, how were\nthe activities and objectives set, are the monitoring and review processes operating correctly and have they been used\nto review and update the plan to ensure it remains relevant for the site? - discussion with senior management on the\ndevelopment and implementation of the plan (refer to clause 1.1.11). - discussions may be conducted across all levels\nof personnel on an informal basis. The auditor would expect to find an awareness of food safety culture, how\nindividuals can impact it, and the company’s objectives. - evidence of the site completing the activities in its action\nplan. - timescales and evidence that they have been met. - monitoring and review processes, and results from previous\nactivities. BRCGS provides a number of services that can support a site’s development of its culture plan, including: -\nan additional voluntary module in product safety culture excellence which helps sites measure the current culture and\nidentify areas for improvement. - a guideline on product safety culture which may be purchased from the BRCGS Store or\nviewed online at BRCGS Participate. - a training course explaining culture and its implementation. Non-conformities To\nensure expectations are understood relating to compliance with clause 1.1.2, its consistent application at certificated\nsites, and assessment during audits, BRCGS has trained auditors and certification bodies to apply the following\nnon-conformities, where sites are noncompliant: - Major non-conformity Where the site does not have a documented plan\nfor food safety and quality culture. In this context a plan is more than a short statement of intent, but is\ndocumentation incorporating all of the requirements of the clause. - Minor non-conformity Where a documented plan\nexists, but: - is of poor quality (e.g. lacks detail such as timescales for completion or clear action plans) - does\nnot cover all the relevant areas or staff - is not fully implemented (e.g. some activities are not implemented or are\nnot completed to a predefined schedule). The final bullet point in the clause requires sites to undertake a review of\nthe effectiveness of completed activities. However, it is possible that this review of the success of the programme\nwould not always be implemented in year 1 (since a review cannot be completed until there are activities to review).\nTherefore non-compliance with this bullet point is not considered a non-conformity at the site’s initial audit, but\nwill be assessed from the site’s second audit to the Standard onwards. The site is expected to complete corrective\naction, root cause analysis and preventive action plans in accordance with section 2.3 of the audit protocol prior to\ncertification, and any nonconformity will be included in the calculation of the site’s grade. Example Food safety and\nquality culture plan The company decides to implement a culture plan. Based on the requirements of the Standard it\nidentifies six key areas to include: - Enhanced training Beyond just managing critical control points (CCPs), to an\nunderstanding of the reasons for the current product safety processes and involving staff in corrective actions. -\nCommunications Regular staff updates in addition to the traditional internal message boards. Updates are used to\ncommunicate production, incidences of non-conforming product, customer complaints and their corrective actions, and\nimprovements in product quality. They also focus on company strategy and product safety objectives. - A clear feedback\nprocess To initiate communication ‘up’ to management, so that communication is not seen just as management ‘telling\nstaff’. - Recognition Management instigates ‘employee of the month’ awards as rewards for successful process\nimprovement ideas. - Behaviours to maintain and improve product safety The site identifies two areas it would like to\nfocus on: - Previously the site had developed reporting and whistleblowing systems which allow staff to feed back\nconcerns relating to product safety, in accordance with clauses 1.1.6 and 1.2.3 of the Standard. However, staff\nfeedback has identified a lack of use of the systems due to: - a lack of encouragement to report errors and product\nsafety concerns - a lack of trust, and a feeling that it is not safe or comfortable to report problems - a belief that\nproblems will not be taken seriously or that nothing will improve. Senior management therefore decides to include staff\nreporting and concerns about the current system in the culture improvement plan, and look for ways to build trust and\nencourage use. - Internal audits are an extremely useful site-based tool for monitoring and improving systems. However,\nthe site notices that many departments undervalue the audit programme, with several reports reflecting a negative\nattitude towards the programme. Senior management also notes that internal audits require effort and resource to\ncomplete robustly and effectively, which have not always been available. In fact, at a previous management meeting the\nsenior leadership had considered the potential to further minimise the internal audit programme (e.g. by resorting to\ntick-box exercises, reducing the number of audits or auditors, and completing the minimum activity possible, rather\nthan reviewing the actual risks). The culture plan therefore includes activities to build belief in, and use of, the\ninternal audit programme, starting with education about the programme and its importance, training for new internal\nauditors, communication of audit results (positives as well as non-conformity), using the management review programme\nto consider learnings from the programme which can further benefit the site. - KPIs The site’s quality KPIs have\nremained constant for a prolonged period. The site decides to use its annual customer reviews as an opportunity to\nreview the quality KPIs to establish their continuing appropriateness. 24 brcgs.com Clause Requirements Example\ncontinued To ensure that the activities proceed according to the plan (and in accordance with the Standard), the site\nmanagement: - assigns timescales for the start of each activity - nominates leaders for each activity with\nresponsibility to lead the activities identified - makes progress against the product safety culture plan an agenda\nitem at the quarterly senior management team meetings - schedules a follow-up staff survey for 12 months’ time which\nwill specifically be used to assess the effectiveness of the planned activities - sets a review date for the complete\nplan."

    "interpretation_guidance": "Food safety and quality objectives Senior management must set objectives concerning food safety, authenticity, legality\nand quality that help to achieve the stated policy (see clause 1.1.1). The objectives must be communicated so that\nstaff understand what is required from them. The setting of these objectives also helps the allocation of suitable\nbudgets and resources. Auditors will look for evidence that the objectives are in place and have been communicated.\nGood objectives are usually: - Specific Objectives should be clear and directly related to the site’s aims or goals for\nproduct safety and quality. - Measurable Objectives should be measurable so that the site can assess progress. -\nAchievable Targets that stretch the company are acceptable but it is important that they are realistic and that\nsufficient resources will be available. - Relevant Objectives should be designed to maintain and improve product safety\nand quality. - Time-bound Objectives can be long-term (e.g. throughout the period of certification) or shorter-term\n(e.g. within the next 3 months); however, the timescales or deadlines should be clear to enable the site to review\nprogress and, if necessary, amend activities. There are many examples of objectives that could be included. For\nexample: - reductions in customer complaints, non-conforming products and/or customer rejections or returns -\nreductions in audit failures or audit non-conformities – include both internal and external audits, but ensure that all\naudits are still completed to a thorough, rigorous quality - improved product safety training - improvements to the\nmanagement of product authenticity - increases to product testing. Interpretation continued In each of these examples\nit would be necessary for the site to consider how to make the objective specific and measurable (as discussed above);\nfor example, 10% fewer customer complaints to be achieved by year end. Objectives associated with product authenticity\nare likely to be formed differently; for example, they may be linked to: - improvements to the traceability systems or\ntraceability testing (section 3.9) - evolution of product monitoring processes such as product testing (section 5.6) -\noutcomes from the vulnerability assessment (section 5.4) - updates to the supplier approval mechanisms and the ongoing\nmonitoring of suppliers (section 3.5). A similar situation exists for objectives associated with legality, as these\nwill also need to be formed differently from those commonly used for product safety. For example, where there is\nproposed legislation in the region where the company operates, then possible targets may relate to ensuring that\nrelevant staff are trained in a timely manner. Progress against targets must be reviewed and reported to senior\nmanagement at least quarterly. It may, for example, be included in management meetings (e.g. those scheduled for clause\n1.1.4), or it may be the subject of a separate review or included in a report to management. Auditors will look for\ndocumented evidence of communication and the quarterly progress review. The Standard also requires communication to\nstaff (including all employees and agencysupplied staff). The Standard is not prescriptive on the methods of\ncommunication used to meet this clause. For example, any of the following could be used: meetings, briefings, cascades,\nhuddles, electronic media (e.g. email), and company noticeboards. Independent sites or facilities that are part of a\nlarge group with company-wide objectives can adopt the company-wide objectives, but are required to ‘own’ the\nobjectives and carry out the implementation, monitoring, review etc. at site level."

    "interpretation_guidance": "Senior management review The purpose of the management review meeting is to take an overview of the food safety\nsystems. It should therefore be a full and detailed examination of what has happened and what should happen in future.\nIt is not the ongoing management of an issue or concern (although the agenda may include a review of any such concerns)\nand it is not just incident/ non-conforming product management (processes for these activities are covered in the\nrelevant sections of the Standard; for example, in sections 3.8 and 3.11). The format of the meeting should reflect\ncompany size. The Standard identifies specific agenda items that must be included within the meeting; however,\nadditional relevant subjects should also be included where appropriate. As a minimum the meeting agenda should\ntherefore consider: - minutes of the previous management reviews and actions agreed. For example, the previous meeting\nmay have set actions and timescales for their completion; however, if actions were not completed on schedule or have\nfailed to be effective, further investigation and actions will be required - what has been achieved or not been\nachieved and progress against objectives (see clause 1.1.3); for example: - if an objective has been met the site can\nconsider future targets based on achievements to date - if an objective has not been met the site can consider why.\nThis can be very informative and allows future objectives (or other actions such as the product safety culture plan) to\nfocus on areas where relevant, achievable actions can take place. This review need not be exhaustive (such as a full\nroot cause analysis) but the site should be able to understand why objectives were not met. The outcome would not be\npreventive action but continual improvement, allowing the site to refine its future targets - internal, second-party\nand/or third-party audits, and subsequent actions. As a minimum the Standard requires a summary of the results from the\ninternal audit programme to be reviewed at these meetings (see clause 3.4.3). This provides two opportunities for the\nsenior management team: - a review of non-conformities, corrective actions, root causes and preventive actions, with a\nfocus on any outstanding concerns or additional actions required (individual issues should have been identified and\nacted upon at the time they were identified and where necessary, escalated to the management team during the year) -\nreview of the overall performance and key trends should facilitate continuous improvement (e.g. changes to the\nfrequency of auditing particular areas, training needs or suggestions for improvements or further developments of the\ninternal audit programme) Similarly, second- or third-party activities (including customer audits, regulatory authority\nvisits) could be summarised to facilitate further discussion and identify any actions or improvements that need to be\nmade - progress against the product safety and quality culture plan and the effectiveness of completed actions -\nproduct safety incidents, complaints, out-of-specification results or non-conforming products, to ensure these have\nbeen fully actioned, to assess any trends and identify any additional follow-up actions or improvements needed as a\nresult of these incidents and non-conforming situations - the management and effectiveness of product safety systems\nsuch as HACCP, food defence and product authenticity, along with any existing or emerging issues relating to these\ntopics Interpretation continued - identification of targets and areas of improvement for the coming year - changes to\nresource requirements. It is important that sufficient information is presented to the meeting to enable a full and\nmeaningful discussion and, where appropriate, actions to be agreed. Senior management is considered to consist of\nmanagers who have the authority to make decisions on food safety objectives and/or the provision of adequate human and\nfinancial resources. The management team would usually include the site manager and those managers responsible for\nproduction, technical operations, purchasing, engineering and human resources. For large, multi-site organisations the\nmanagement review meeting may include head office representatives, but this decision should be driven by the senior\nmanagement on site. It may also include representatives from any departments responsible for specific product safety\nactivities or for specific agenda items. Good practice is to ensure that the meeting is put into all attendees’ diaries\nsufficiently early to maximise attendance and that agendas and papers are circulated in advance. The auditor will be\nlooking for evidence that, for each agenda item, sufficient information has been provided to allow an informed\ndiscussion to take place leading to appropriate action plans. This may be demonstrated through a review of the inputs\nto the meeting, minutes of the discussion of the items and, where necessary, agreed action plans. To demonstrate that,\nfor example, senior management has reviewed the management of the HACCP system, the minutes should contain a general\nsummary of the HACCP review meeting (see section 2.12.3) and a record of its outcomes (these would be inputs into the\nmanagement review meeting), together with any actions requested during the senior management meeting (i.e. outputs of\nmanagement review meeting). One of the outputs from the meeting is a review of performance against the objectives\n(clause 1.1.3) and the establishment of new or amended targets and objectives for the following year. This should be\nclearly documented within the minutes of the meeting. The outcomes from the review meeting must be communicated to the\nrelevant staff to ensure implementation. It should be evident to the auditor how this has been achieved (e.g. cascaded\nthrough staff briefings or posted on noticeboards). It should also be evident that actions are followed up and\ncompleted. For example, evidence of completion could be added to meeting records, or assessment of actions could be\nadded to the internal audit programme. The Standard requires an annual review, such as a regular annual management\nreview meeting. However, it is important that meetings are scheduled correctly and of sufficient frequency to maximise\nthe value of the meeting and allow timely actions. Many companies opt to make a review or partial review more\nfrequently (e.g. every 6 months or each quarter), either addressing all the points in summary (after other review\nmeetings) or addressing one or two points in depth in each meeting. The number of meetings and the individual agendas\nshould be based on company need, providing all relevant topics are covered within the 12-month period. Where meetings\nare scheduled with a large intervening period (e.g. annually) the site needs a process to ensure that any matters\nneeding consideration can be completed in a timely fashion; for example, by incorporating them into management meeting\nagendas (see clause 1.1.5). 28 brcgs.com Clause Requirements Interpretation continued Special consideration should be\ngiven to seasonal and temporary sites to ensure meetings occur at an appropriate point in the season and that actions,\ntargets or objectives can be completed. Some sites therefore opt for two meetings; for example, one at the start of the\nseason, to allow objective setting, and one at the end of the season, when the season’s information can be assessed.\nAlternatively, a management meeting shortly after an external audit allows any non-conformities to be included in the\ndiscussion and relevant corrective actions to be agreed. All sites should have a predefined schedule so all\nparticipants are aware, in advance, of when the meetings will take place."

The company’s senior management shall have a process for assessing any concerns raised.\nRecords of the assessment and, where appropriate, actions taken, shall be documented.",
    "interpretation_guidance": "Confidential reporting system (whistleblowing) In 2018 a report from the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners found\nthat reports from employees and outside parties are by far the most common method of detecting wrongdoing. It is\ntherefore vital that all sites facilitate effective communication methods allowing staff to report any concerns.\nIdeally, this will be achievable using procedures developed to meet clause 1.2.3. However, from time to time it may be\nnecessary for individuals to report on hazards or infractions anonymously and confidentially (e.g. if a staff member\nfelt that a genuine concern raised through other mechanisms, such as those covered in clause 1.2.3, had not been\nadequately addressed), so the site (or company) should have a system in place to manage this. Although the aim of the\nStandard is to ensure these reporting systems relate to product safety, authenticity, quality and legality, the company\nmay choose to incorporate all staff concerns into the system, and not limit it to concerns related to the scope of the\nStandard. As a minimum, the system used must ensure that the confidentiality of the employee reporting the concern is\nmaintained (i.e. the employee’s identity is not known or released to the site or company management) to protect any\nstaff using it, and the confidential and anonymous nature of the system should be clear to all staff. An email or\ntelephone call to an on-site manager, for example, is unlikely to be anonymous or confidential as the manager is likely\nto know the employee’s email address or recognise their voice. Therefore this would not be considered a confidential\nsystem. Many food processors will also have whistleblowing systems established by the brand owners and retailers for\nwhich it produces. Where this is the case, the site is still required to have its own system as affected products may\nnot relate to the specific brand owner. Additionally, in some areas, local relevant regulatory authorities will have\nfacilities for confidential reports about a site but this also does not mitigate the need for a site (or company) to\nhave a system. As well as gathering information, the site is required to collate and act on it. The auditor will expect\nto see a system in place, and transparency about the content of any reports and actions, although not the source of the\noriginal concern. Where possible, sites might consider an independent system that receives and processes any concerns\nraised with appropriate promptness. For example, where quality, safety or conformity of the product is at risk, action\nshould be immediate. This might be by using an independent consultant or a professional organisation that can act as an\nintermediary. 30 brcgs.com Clause Requirements Interpretation continued Where local legal requirements prohibit certain\nactivities around confidentiality or such reports, the site will need to ensure the system employed meets these legal\nrequirements. This will also be acknowledged by the auditor and compliance with this clause noted within the context of\nthe legal framework. It is not uncommon for larger companies to base the management of their confidential reporting\nsystems at head office, rather than at each individual site. This is acceptable and the audit process is explained in\nAppendix 4 of the Standard. BRCGS operates the independent ‘Tell BRCGS’ facility (available online). This has been\ndesigned so that BRCGS can receive information from any interested party about the status of certificated sites or the\ncertification process. Therefore, when feedback is received, it will be investigated and this may, for example,\nidentify the need for a compliance audit at the implicated site to ensure that it is operating legally and in\ncompliance with the Standard. This is different from the aim of this whistleblowing clause, which is to provide the\nsite/ company management with an opportunity to receive and address any concerns raised by employees without the site\nbeing subject to an external review. Therefore, a site using the Tell BRCGS system without its own confidential\nreporting system will not achieve the intended aim of the clause, although it could be used for situations where an\nemployee has tried other site-specific options and is still sufficiently concerned to raise the matter with BRCGS."

Therefore, non-conformities identified in the previous certification audit must have been fully and\neffectively rectified (i.e. corrective and preventive actions completed) and these will be checked during the current\naudit. Therefore, for each non-conformity at the last audit, the auditor will expect to see: - Corrective action The\nsite will have completed its corrective action within 28 days of the last audit. The auditor will therefore expect to\nsee this action in operation (e.g. that the updated procedure submitted to the certification body as evidence of\ncorrective action is in use, or that repairs have been completed and remain effective). 34 brcgs.com Clause\nRequirements Interpretation continued - Preventive action At the time when the certificate was awarded, the site will\nhave submitted a preventive action plan, but may not have completed all of the preventive action. The auditor will\ntherefore expect to see evidence that the site implemented preventive action and that recurrence of the non-conformity\nhas therefore been effectively prevented. - Root cause analysis Root cause analysis is used to identify the fundamental\nor root cause of a non-conformity, and is therefore a key activity in establishing appropriate preventive action.\nAlthough the site submitted the root cause analysis following the previous audit, the auditor may need to review this;\nfor example, if preventive action has been ineffective at preventing the non-conformity. This process is detailed in II\nof the Standard, section 2.3.2. Many sites have found it useful to retain copies of records and documents implicated by\nnon-conformities with the audit records. This allows quick and easy reference to the specific document while reviewing,\ninvestigating and correcting the non-conformity. (The original copy of the document, should, of course, be returned to\nthe appropriate place in the site’s quality system.) Note that additional information on preventive action and root\ncause analysis, and nonconforming situations which require their use, is detailed in I, section 3.7 of the Standard,\nand especially clause 3.7.2. A site’s attitude towards preventive action may also indicate its product safety culture.\nFor example, minimal follow-up, or preventive action that is just seen as a necessary document to pass an audit, may be\na sign of a poor culture. BRCGS has published a guideline to understanding preventive action and root cause analysis\nwhich explains some of the techniques available for identifying the cause of non-conformities and preventing them from\nrecurring. The guideline is available from the BRCGS Store or viewed online at BRCGS Participate. If effective\ncorrective or preventive action has not been introduced (e.g. it has been ineffective at preventing recurrence), a\nnon-conformity may be raised against this clause, in addition to a non-conformity against the clause that has the\nrecurring issue."

For example, the\nrequirements of clause 1.2.1, regarding deputies and documented procedures, apply even where a food safety consultant\nis used. A food safety consultant is seen as a service provider to the site and is therefore subject to the\nrequirements of section 3.5.3. 38 The food safety plan – HACCP Fundamental The company shall have a fully implemented\nand effective food safety plan incorporating the Codex Alimentarius HACCP principles. Interpretation The purpose of\nthese requirements is to create a food safety plan to mitigate food safety hazards. The foundation of this food safety\nplan is a hazard and risk analysis. In order to be effective this analysis must be systematic, sciencebased, thorough,\nfully implemented and kept up to date. In the food industry, the principles for assessing hazard and risk are commonly\nreferred to as HACCP. However, the specific terminology used in the Standard, such as prerequisites and critical\ncontrol points (CCPs), are drawn from global terminology used to describe expectations. Sites are not required to use\nthe specific terminology used in the Standard; alternative terminology is acceptable, providing it is evident that all\nthe requirements have been fully met. For example, legislative requirements in the US (detailed in the Food Safety\nModernization Act) use different terminology but still incorporate all the requirements of the Standard. Sites are\nadvised to avoid having multiple plans with different terminology as this is administratively complex and unnecessary.\n(It may, of course, be appropriate to have multiple plans where a site produces different types of products with\ndifferent product safety hazards, but common terminology should be used throughout.) Regardless of the terminology used\nthe food safety plan must incorporate all of the Codex Alimentarius HACCP principles. The clauses in Issue 9 have been\nupdated to reflect the latest publication of the Codex Alimentarius HACCP principles, therefore where it is evident\nthat all the requirements in section 2 have been fully met, a site will not be expected to undertake additional\nactivities to meet the Codex Alimentarius principles. The plan must be specific to the products manufactured, processed\nor packed on site and the production processes used. Codex Alimentarius has published background information and\nextensive guidance on the HACCP principles which can be found in the General Principles of Food Hygiene (CXC1-1969)\nlast updated in 2020. It can be downloaded from the Codex Alimentarius page on the FAO’s website. BRCGS offers training\non HACCP implementation. Details are available from the BRCGS website."

    "interpretation_guidance": "The HACCP food safety team (aligned with Codex Alimentarius Step 1) For a comprehensive HACCP or food safety plan to be\nestablished, maintained and kept up to date it needs to be managed by a nominated team with suitable training, relevant\nskills and experience. The number of HACCP food safety team members needs to be appropriate to the size and structure\nof the company, as the team will include representatives of each department with responsibility for the operation of\nthe Standard (e.g. technical, quality assurance, purchasing, engineering, new product development, hygiene/sanitation\nand senior leadership team). There will always be more than one person, since a single person does not constitute a\n‘team’. The team needs knowledge of the types of operations that are carried out at the site and the hazards these\noperations may present to the product. It is good practice to document the team members within the study, with a\nsummary of their roles, experience and areas of responsibility within the company. Membership of the HACCP food safety\nteam needs to be reviewed and, when necessary, updated (e.g. when job responsibilities change or personnel leave or\njoin the company). The team leader must be able to demonstrate competency and experience in HACCP/food safety\nprocesses. This can be shown by: - the quality of the plan - documented evidence of their qualification (e.g.\nsuccessful completion of an industryrecognised HACCP training course) - demonstrable, extensive experience in\nimplementing or training HACCP. The team will need sufficient knowledge of HACCP processes, products manufactured on\nsite, production processes and relevant hazards, to facilitate a thorough hazard and risk analysis and the creation of\nan appropriate food safety plan. This may be demonstrated by, for example, training records (see clause 7.1.6) that\nshow adequate training (e.g. through an industry-recognised training course or good quality internal training) has been\ngiven to all HACCP food safety team members. Any format or delivery method of training is permitted; however, the\noutcome should be a suitably trained individual capable of executing a HACCP or food safety plan as part of their team.\nWhere there is a legal requirement for specific training the site is expected to ensure this has been completed. Where\nexternal expertise has been used in developing the HACCP or food safety plan, the site must demonstrate ownership of\nthe identified requirements by ensuring that the dayto-day management of the food safety system remains the\nresponsibility of the site (see clause 1.2.4). At the audit, the competency and understanding of the HACCP/food safety\nplan team will be assessed, as well as the quality of the resultant HACCP or food safety plan. The site should also be\nable to establish the training and competence of any external consultant in HACCP/food safety principles (see section\n3.5.3). Senior management commitment (clauses 1.1.1 to 1.1.14) is required to support the HACCP food safety team. This\nmay be demonstrated by the presence of senior management within the team, policy statements referring to HACCP or food\nsafety, or evidence within management review meetings that HACCP/food safety issues are discussed and reviewed. 40\nbrcgs.com Clause Requirements Interpretation continued The existence of a food safety plan does not, in itself,\nguarantee product safety, and it is vital that the results of the HACCP or food safety plan are implemented, applied\ncorrectly and integrated into the food safety and quality management system."

Note that the list of examples in the Standard is not exhaustive, and\nothers will exist in some sites; for example, utilities, air and general aspects of the production environment. Sites\nmust therefore define the full range of prerequisites applicable to their site and operations. Although the\nprerequisites are usually covered by day-to-day activities such as good manufacturing or hygiene practices, it is vital\nthat they work effectively and to the correct standards as: - The prerequisite programme needs to provide a solid base\non which the rest of the HACCP or food safety plan can be developed. - The company is relying on the prerequisite\nactivities to mitigate the identified hazards and deliver safe product (e.g. if a site identifies cleaning as a\nprerequisite, then it relies on the cleaning activities to adequately remove food residues and dirt that might\notherwise result in hazards such as allergen cross-contamination or microbiological contamination). Therefore there\nshould be a whole work stream behind each identified prerequisite to ensure that the relevant activity, procedures and\npolicies are in place, that they are working correctly and that they continue to deliver the level of control required.\nAlthough the prerequisite programme is expected to be effective in achieving the level of control required to ensure\nfood safety, it is not a requirement that a documented validation of every prerequisite is undertaken, as prerequisite\nprogrammes typically cover a wide range of general environmental controls, often with results that are not\nquantifiable. However, where a prerequisite programme is used to manage a specific hazard (e.g. cleaning regimes used\nto prevent allergen cross-contamination), there needs to be a documented validation that the prerequisite controls the\nidentified hazard (see clause 2.7.4 for further details regarding the validation). Some companies prefer to\ndifferentiate prerequisites that manage specific hazards from other prerequisites by referring to them as operational\nprerequisites (oPRPs). Sites that need to meet the requirements of the US Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) should\nnote that they must ensure that preventive controls are subject to validation and verification. Some of these controls\nmay cover activities that have traditionally formed part of the prerequisite programme. The clause contains references\nto later sections of the Standard which provide detail on the requirements for effective management of some specific\nprerequisites, including cleaning (section 4.11), pest management (section 4.14) and training (section 7.1). These are\nnot intended to be an exhaustive list of all prerequisites or all the relevant sections of the Standard. The\nprerequisite programmes are often dependent on the production risk zoning (see clause 4.3.1); for example, cleaning\nwithin a high-risk zone. Therefore it may be necessary to place greater attention on some prerequisites that are\nparticularly important for food safety in those specific zones. Good practice is to review the prerequisite programmes\nand their management. The frequency of this review should be based on risk, but it could be included, for example, in\nthe annual review of the HACCP or food safety plan. 42 .3 Describe the product (equivalent to Codex Alimentarius Step\n2) Clause Requirements"

The Standard provides examples of\nthose that should be considered, including: - specific micro-organisms (e.g. E. coli or Salmonella) - specific\nchemicals (e.g. veterinary residues, pesticides or radiological contaminants) - cleaning chemicals - machinery\nlubricants - specific foreign bodies (e.g. glass, metal or plastic) - specific allergens (e.g. peanuts or egg); i.e.\nthose identified by the company, materials that are considered allergens in the country of intended sale and any\ncustomer requirements - the potential for fraud and/or adulteration - malicious tampering with the product or\nprocesses. It is important that the company considers all relevant potential hazards from all relevant sources. These\ncould include raw materials, processes and the factory environment. The process flow diagram is a useful tool in\nconsidering the potential risks at each stage of production. Some sites find it useful to consider each hazard, at each\nstep, in terms of: - whether the hazard is likely to be present in, for example, the raw material or the processing\nenvironment - whether there is the potential to introduce or create a specific hazard at the step in the process being\nconsidered - if there is the potential for growth of micro-organisms - whether the hazard will survive the processing\nstep; for example, whether a pathogen can survive in the product, or whether the contaminant is stable to the process\nbeing completed (e.g. heat stable). There must be a description of each hazard and its sources – one hazard may have\nseveral potential sources and occur at more than one point in the process. This is important to ensure that effective\ncontrols for each source of hazard are established in the subsequent steps of the process. The Standard has referenced\nfood fraud and malicious contamination (food defence) in the list of hazards in this clause to draw attention to the\nneed to include these within site assessments. However, later sections of the Standard (sections 4.2 and 5.4) provide\ngreater detail on the expected activity in these areas. This clause does not require those assessments to be repeated\nor duplicated (as part of the HACCP plan, and then in compliance with sections 4.2 and 5.4) – separate assessment\nprocesses are acceptable and the site can reference the additional assessment within the HACCP plan. However, the\noutputs from those separate assessments must be considered as part of this process, to ensure that the correct\ncontrols, monitoring, verification, etc. are in place. The aim of including radiological hazards within the clause is\nto consider potential contamination by radioactive isotopes (a legal requirement in some countries) which may be\npresent in water or soil (either from a naturally occurring source or resulting from contamination caused by humans). A\nnumber of authorities produce reports on known radiological hazards; for example: 52 brcgs.com Clause Requirements\nInterpretation continued In the UK: - FSA: Radioactivity in Food and the Environment (RIFE) - UK Health Security\nAgency: Three Steps to Manage Radon in Buildings – Check, Measure, Act - UK government: Radioactivity in Food and the\nEnvironment (RIFE) Reports.

    "interpretation_guidance": "Documented management system The control of all documents within the food safety and quality system (for both external\nand internal use) is important for several reasons, including: - the documents are kept up to date - staff are working\nwith the correct version - the potential for mistakes caused by multiple versions of a document is minimised. Therefore\nall documents in use need to be properly authorised and must be the correct version. The Standard requires the site to\nhave a documented procedure that describes the method by which documents are controlled and managed. This procedure\nneeds to include instructions on how the following features of the document management system are controlled: -\nresponsibilities for the management of the system - list of all controlled documents, indicating the current version\nnumber and the allocation of controlled copies of the document (see below) - identification of controlled documents\n(e.g. document ID, issue date, version number) - records of the reason for any change(s) (see below) - method of\nrescinding and replacing documents. In order to demonstrate the control of document issue, it is necessary to maintain\na register of all controlled documents, their allocation and issue status. Where the controlled documents are all\ncontained on an electronic system, it is usual for printed versions to be marked as uncontrolled. Each copy must be\nauthorised (e.g. with a signature or stamp) to show it is for use, and each must be given a version number so that\nout-of-date documents can be identified and removed. This must be evidenced by the fact that all documents in use are\nthe most up-to-date versions. Where documents are maintained electronically, the site is required to ensure that they\nare stored securely and cannot be amended by unauthorised persons; for example, by using individual passwords or\nsecurity swipe cards. This includes backing them up appropriately to ensure no data is lost. The auditor will ask to\nsee evidence (e.g. a procedure) that the site has an effective backup process, rather than auditing that the backup\ncontains all the relevant files. Interpretation continued The methodology or type of electronic storage is not\nspecified. The site may choose to use an internal server to store data; or it may use cloud services, which are\ngenerally considered to be secure and backed up, providing there is control of authorised/authenticated users. When a\ndocument is changed, a record needs to be made of the change and the reason for it. This can be achieved by keeping a\ncopy of the previous version with the reason for the change written on it, or by keeping a history of amendments.\nConsideration should also be given to the most effective method of communicating the changes to staff; for example, by\nhighlighting the change within the new document or training relevant staff. Further guidance How to put a document\ncontrol procedure in place Firstly, ensure there is a single, clear, documented system that operates across all\ndocuments within the food safety and quality management system and that it includes the minimum requirements\nhighlighted in the Standard: - identification of the individual(s) responsible for management of the system (i.e. who\nis authorised to issue or amend documents). This might be someone with the authority to instigate and maintain the\nsystem - the list of all controlled documents - methods of identification of controlled documents - records regarding\nthe reasons for any changes - the method of collecting and replacing documents. List of documents Your site needs a\nlist of all the documents within the food safety and quality system. Typically this will include: - the document\nidentification or number. The Standard does not set out how you should identify your documents, but an example format\nwould be using sequentially numbered documents or an initial letter (often representing a department or activity)\nfollowed by a number (e.g. P0123); Figure 6 shows an example - the document title. Use a concise title that clearly\nexplains the purpose or content of the document (e.g. ‘metal detector check procedure’) - the current issue or version\nnumber. Each time the document is updated, amended or replaced, a new version number should be used - the issue date.\nInclude the date when the current version of the document first came into force - withdrawal date (if applicable) -\nreview date (if applicable). Documents may require periodic review to ensure the information remains applicable and up\nto date - the allocation of controlled copies (i.e. who has a copy of the document). 66 brcgs.com Clause Requirements\nFurther guidance continued REFERENCE NUMBER TITLE VERSION NUMBER ISSUE DATE WITHDRAWAL REVIEW DATE ALLOCATED COPIES\nP101 Metal Detection Check Procedure 1"

Each internal audit within the\nprogramme shall have a defined scope and consider a specific activity or a section of the HACCP or food safety plan.",
    "interpretation_guidance": "Internal audit programme The scope of internal audits needs to be established and must ensure that all aspects of the\nfood safety and quality management systems (including the HACCP programme, prerequisite programmes, policies,\ndocumentation, hygiene and production), the product safety and quality culture plan, and systems associated with\nauthenticity, product legality and quality management are audited at least annually. All the internal audits should not\nbe conducted on a single day; nor should every internal audit attempt to cover all aspects of the food safety and\nquality management system or the Standard. A once-a-year check against all the requirements of the Standard may be of\nvalue as a gap analysis when preparing for an audit or confirming the contents of the food safety and quality\nmanagement systems, but is insufficient to cover the full requirements of an internal audit programme as it will not\nprovide the depth of assessment or level of confidence required. Development of the internal audit schedule should\nbegin with a risk assessment. The aim of this is to identify: - all the areas or activities that need to be audited -\nthe frequency with which each part of the product safety and quality management system needs to be audited. This will\nbe dependent on the risk inherent in each activity or section of the food safety and quality management system. For\nexample, the site should be aware of the consequences of not complying with its own systems, which could lead to\nhazards not being identified in a timely manner. Therefore internal audits of CCPs are likely to be more frequent than\nthose for less critical activities. Frequency may also be influenced by known issues within the company or customer\nrequirements. This may result in a site needing to audit an activity multiple times throughout the year, or developing\na programme with more than four internal audit dates (see below) 72 brcgs.com Clause Requirements Interpretation\ncontinued - the most relevant dates for each internal audit; for example, if activities or processes are seasonal (see\nbelow) or if specific activities need to be completed more than once a year. Sites may also find it useful to consider\ncompleting internal audits during different shifts, including, for example, nights or weekends. The majority of sites\nare likely to benefit from a programme of audit dates spread diversely throughout the year, as this maximises the\nopportunity to identify any non-conforming processes in a timely manner, allowing correction and minimising the\npotential for standards to fall between audits. The Standard promotes this concept by requiring a minimum of four audit\ndates spread throughout the year. However, it does not require all audits to be completed quarterly, as there may be\ngenuine situations where risk assessment shows an alternative frequency. Seasonality is an example; if a site is open\nonly for part of the year, then there is little value in completing internal audits while the site is shut. For\nseasonal production, the site is not expected to complete a series of internal audits when the site is not operating;\nhowever, there must be a system for the management of start-up processes, and internal audits are therefore expected to\nstart before the season commences to ensure the site is ready to start production. For example, the HACCP programme\nshould be audited to ensure that it is up to date and appropriate for the forthcoming production; that hygiene and\nfabrication are correct; and that staff are appropriately trained. The remaining areas of the internal audit programme\nshould be covered throughout the season. Further information is available in the BRCGS Fresh Produce Guideline\navailable from BRCGS Participate or the BRCGS Store. Even where a site is open throughout the year, seasonality can\naffect the internal audit dates; for example, if certain activities, such as the harvest of grapes or bottling of wine,\nare only completed at certain times, or if there are seasonal changes in production volumes which apply a greater\nburden on the product safety systems at certain times of year. Where a site is part of a multi-site company, and the\ncompany conducts annual corporate food safety audits, it is acceptable for this annual audit to be incorporated into\nthe internal audit schedule. However, additional internal audits that look at specific parts of the food safety and\nquality system, and compliance with the Standard, should be scheduled throughout the rest of the year. The most common\nway of completing an internal audit is by taking documented procedures and work instructions and comparing them with\nthe actual working practices and records. Note that a tick-box exercise is not sufficient, as it does not provide the\nrigour or depth that an effective internal audit programme requires. The use of an external consultant (e.g. by small\nsites) is acceptable, providing the internal audit programme is scheduled throughout the year and not in a single block\nof activity. See clause 1.2.4 and section 3.5.3 for details relating to the requirements for product safety\nconsultants. BRCGS has produced a guideline to internal auditing which is available on BRCGS Participate or from the\nBRCGS Store."

It should ultimately contribute towards the site’s continuous improvement.\nAuditing is therefore an acquired skill and auditors need to be trained and competent to ensure they are carrying out\nthis function effectively. Training should include: - auditing skills, such as how to complete an effective audit -\nrelevant technical knowledge of the activity to be audited, such as HACCP or appropriate product technical knowledge.\nThis may be by work experience in the sector or specific training - soft skills associated with auditing. Internal\nauditors must be able to show via training records (clause 7.1.6) that they have received formal training on internal\nauditing, via either attendance at an external course or training within the company. Training should also cover the\nplanning and scheduling of the internal audits, preparing audit reports in the company’s agreed format, the correct use\nof audit techniques (e.g. documentation and process auditing, audit trails and discussions with colleagues) and\nfollow-up of audit findings (see clause 3.4.3). Training must be of sufficient duration and depth to ensure that\nauditors can complete robust, consistent audits. External auditors may be used where internal resources are\ninsufficient, providing the requirements of clause 3.4.1 can be met (for scheduling audits throughout the year). The\nsite should refer to clause 1.2.4 and section 3.5.3 for the requirements for the management of food safety consultants.\nInternal auditors must be independent of the process being audited. This is to ensure that there is no conflict of\ninterest (i.e. that the audit is rigorous and thorough) and that any work needed to make corrections or improvements\ncan be identified by an auditor who is not biased or influenced by working in the area.

    "interpretation_guidance": "Internal audit records and corrective actions The management review processes (see clause 1.1.4) must ensure that the\ninternal audit programme operates effectively and that necessary corrective or preventive actions are appropriately\ncompleted. As a result, the internal audit process will often contain a number of steps. For example: - internal audit\ncompleted - corrective actions agreed - corrective actions completed and signed off - completion verified - root cause\nanalysis used to identify any necessary preventive actions - preventive actions completed and reviewed - overall\nmanagement review completed. Each internal audit must examine the process or activity in detail and will usually\ninclude a number of activities such as: - observing how activities are completed - asking relevant staff how an\nactivity is completed or why it is completed in a specific way - reviewing procedures and records to confirm whether\nthe activity has been completed and recorded correctly. In addition to the actual internal audit, it is important that\nappropriate reports are completed, clearly indicating what was audited, the actions that are agreed and the review of\nthese actions. Reports must show evidence of conformity as well as non-conformity, with objective supporting evidence\n(e.g. what documents or actions were observed). Some sites have also found it useful to include recommendations for\nimprovement, where the audit can highlight any that are noted during the audit. Tick lists showing that items have been\nassessed will not normally be accepted as the only form of evidence; information showing how the audited items have\nfulfilled the requirements, or how they are non-compliant, is required. This is important, as recording conformity is\ndocumenting evidence that due diligence is taking place; in other words, that required procedures are taking place, and\nhave been observed by auditors who are independent of the process. This may subsequently be useful, for example, in the\nevent of an incident, or for answering questions from regulatory authorities or customers. Interpretation continued\nNotes, references or copies of the documents and records should be kept as evidence of aspects that have been examined,\nto allow an independent reviewer to reach the same conclusion as the internal auditor. For example, the dates and\ntitles of records that were inspected should be noted in sufficient detail to allow them to be traced; if any records\nare non-compliant, precise details of the non-compliance should be given. The listing of records reviewed also ensures\nthat a wide range of records are considered (e.g. training records of a variety of staff rather than repeated audits of\nthe same records). Records will also confirm whether anything has changed since the last audit. The Standard is not\nprescriptive regarding the format of the internal audit reports; for example, they may be hand-written, stand-alone\nelectronic documents or uploaded into a company database. Good practice is to retain any auditor notes that are\ncompleted during the audit, as well as the final report. Figure 9 shows a typical example of a completed audit report.\nThe results of audits need to be communicated to the relevant staff; i.e. those who are responsible for the area or\nactivity, and corrective actions, root cause and preventive actions and timescales for their completion agreed. This\nmay be achieved via operational or review meetings, or via an update at the end of the audit combined with\ndocumentation such as a memo or a copy of the audit report. Responsibility for corrective actions must be documented –\nfor example, by being recorded on the audit record sheet. Full details for handling non-conformities, including\ncorrective and preventive actions, are provided in section 3.7. Note that finding a non-conformity during an internal\naudit should not necessarily be viewed as a negative, since it allows the site to implement action before the\nnon-conformity becomes a more serious problem. Where non-conformities have been identified, effective completion of\ncorrective and preventive action must be verified. Good practice is to ensure that a nominated member of staff with the\nappropriate authority checks that the action has been taken within the agreed timescale, and that this has rectified\nthe problem sufficiently to prevent recurrence. The nominated staff member should not be the person responsible for\ncompletion of the actions; ideally this should be the original auditor. Good practice is to complete a review of the\ninternal audit programme; for example, looking at the outputs and trends, and any insight these provide. A summary of\nthe programme and results will also be required for the management review meeting (see clause 1.1.4). A non-conformity\nwill be raised against clause 3.4.3 if there is a non-conformity in the operation of the internal audit programme\nitself. Examples include if the audit schedule is not properly implemented or if corrective and preventive actions are\nnot completed within the agreed timescales.

    "interpretation_guidance": "Documented inspections In addition to the internal audit programme the Standard requires a programme of documented\ninspections to ensure that the factory environment and processing equipment are maintained in a suitable condition.\nThese inspections are different from the internal audit programme specified in clauses 3.4.1 to 3.4.3, which examines\npractices against documented procedures. Audits are an in-depth challenge to the systems and procedures that a site has\nput in place to manage hazards, to confirm that the site is effectively mitigating identified risks. A documented\ninspection, however, is a simpler approach to assessing the conditions present, so an entirely separate inspection plan\nshould be in place. These hygiene- and fabrication-based inspections assess standards of cleaning, equipment, building\nfabrication and personal hygiene to ensure that high standards are maintained and that a safe, hygienic production\nenvironment is in place. For example, inspections should include: - appropriateness, status, state of repair and\ncleaning of doors, walls, floors and other fabrication and facilities (e.g. those detailed in section 4.4) - hygiene\ninspection to confirm equipment and facilities have been suitably cleaned - equipment inspection to identify and\ncontrol potential foreign bodies (e.g. from worn or damaged equipment) before they have the opportunity to contaminate\na product. The frequency of the inspections should be based on risk. For open product areas, inspections need to be at\nleast monthly, whereas inspections in high-care and high-risk areas are likely to be more frequent (e.g. daily or\nweekly); seasonal products or activities should be included where appropriate. Line start-up checks, which may occur\ndaily or at shift changes in many operations, can form part of this inspection programme. It is also good practice to\ncomplete inspections after any activities that potentially change the risk to products; for example, after maintenance.\nA review of the inspection programme should be completed prior to any changes which may affect food safety; for\nexample: 78 brcgs.com Clause Requirements Interpretation continued - introducing new equipment or facilities - changes\nto products - changes to processing conditions or process flow - following a non-conformity in an audit (e.g. internal,\nBRCGS, customer, or regulatory audit) or an independent inspection (e.g. following recommendations for improvement from\nthe pest control in-depth survey). The individuals responsible for completing these inspections should be suitably\ntrained for the systems they are checking. However, staff completing hygiene and fabrication inspections do not need\nthe same level of training as internal auditors. The absolute requirements for independence identified in clause 3.4.2\ndo not always apply to these inspections; for example, it would be acceptable for line start-up checks to be carried\nout by line supervisors or managers. External agencies may be used to carry out inspections. It is important that\nissues identified at the inspections are corrected as soon as possible so that product risk is minimised. The records\nof inspections and corrective actions must be retained. Inspection records can provide useful information to identify\ntrends and drive improvements (e.g. through the use of scored inspection results). To facilitate this, and to promote\ndiscussions about improvements to hygiene and fabrication, a summary of the results will be discussed at the management\nreview meetings (see clause 1.1.4)."

The company must document its procedure for supplier approval and monitoring. This needs to\ninclude the methods of approval, frequency of monitoring, responsibilities and how the process will be managed. The\nacceptable methods of supplier approval will depend on the raw material and the risks associated with it (e.g. the\noutput of clause 3.5.1.1). They will include one or more of the following activities: - Certification to the relevant\nBRCGS Standard, such as the Global Standard Food Safety; Packaging Materials; Storage and Distribution; Agents and\nBrokers; or another of the GFSI-benchmarked schemes. The site must confirm the validity of the certification. This will\ninclude: - Confirmation of the certification status (e.g. this can be confirmed on an independent database; for BRCGS\nStandards it can be confirmed in the BRCGS Directory). Photocopies of certificates are not recommended and on their own\nare not considered suitable validation of certification status. During the BRCGS audit the site may be asked to\ndemonstrate its validation process. Interpretation continued - Confirmation that the certification remains up to date\n(e.g. by receiving confirmation of successful completion of the recertification processes or by recording certificate\nexpiry dates and completing checks for ongoing certification). - Ensuring that the raw materials are within the scope\nof the certification. Where the product has been excluded from the scope of certification it cannot be assumed that all\nof the processes relating to its manufacture have been conducted in accordance with the certification requirements. For\nexample, different facilities or equipment may be used; different raw material suppliers or risk assessment; or\ndifferent staff training. Therefore the site will need to undertake additional supplier approval processes to ensure\nthe material is satisfactory and any risks are appropriately managed. A successful site audit covers at a minimum\nproduct safety, traceability, HACCP, product security and the food defence plan (i.e. systems to protect the product\nfrom theft and malicious activity), product authenticity and good manufacturing processes. This audit must be completed\nby an appropriately experienced and competent auditor (i.e. someone who has completed training in auditing techniques,\nhas experience of auditing, and has knowledge of the product, ingredient or processes being audited). Non-conformities\nshould be addressed (e.g. in an agreed action plan with timescales) unless they are critical to product safety or\nlegality, in which case supply should not be permitted until the non-conformities have been satisfactorily addressed.\nWhen deciding the type of supplier audit to complete the company should consider the risks associated with the raw\nmaterial and supplier, using this information to decide the format and duration of the audit, and whether the risk\nassessment indicates that some or all of the requirements can be completed remotely, or whether an entirely on-site\naudit is required. If the raw material supplier is independently audited to another standard that is not\nGFSIbenchmarked, this may be acceptable as an alternative to the site completing its own audit of the supplier\nproviding that: - the scope of the audit meets the requirements of the Standard (i.e. at a minimum product safety,\ntraceability, HACCP review, product security and food defence, food authenticity and good manufacturing practices) -\nthe site has a copy of the full audit report (not just a certificate) - the supplier can demonstrate the competence of\nthe auditor. Where risk assessment (completed as part of this clause) indicates that a supplier is low risk (e.g. due\nto history of trading with the site or the nature of the raw materials traded) the completion of a supplier\nquestionnaire with a focus on food safety and quality may be sufficient. If a supplier questionnaire is the only\nmechanism used to assess a supplier (i.e. there are no additional activities such as supplier audits) then it is\nimportant that the questionnaire (and replies from the ingredient supplier) contains all the relevant information to\nallow the site to confidently make a decision on approval. The auditor will expect to see, and will challenge, risk\nassessments. Approval and the associated risk assessments must be up to date.

Therefore, while a company may wish to include other\ncriteria (e.g. financial considerations or reliability of delivery schedules) these additional criteria must not\noutweigh the need to fully assess food safety, authenticity, legality and quality considerations. As a guide, typical\ncriteria may include: - known risks associated with the raw material or supplier - supplier approach to emerging\nconcerns - incidences of contamination or non-conforming raw materials - quality of material supplied. The frequency of\nongoing approval is also important, and this is left to the site to determine. However, where approval is based on\nsupplier questionnaires, these must be reissued at least every 3 years.

The purpose of this clause is\ntherefore to ensure that essential information relating to traceability, product safety, authenticity, food defence,\netc. is maintained and relevant details communicated, where a site has purchased a raw material from an agent or\nbroker, or a wholesaler (i.e. not the manufacturer, packer or consolidator).

For the purposes of the Standard, a place of consolidation of bulk materials is\na location where a number of smaller batches are mixed to form a single bulk material (e.g. where a number of farms\nsupply grain, which the grain merchant combines in a silo before sale, or where a cooperative arranges for a group of\nsmall growers to combine their crops for onward sale to customers). The important difference between consolidation and\nother types of storage or trade of materials is the mixing or combining of materials from multiple sources or batches,\nso that it is no longer possible to identify the individual supplier/batch for any specific portion of the bulk\nmaterial (of course, for traceability purposes, it must still be possible to identify all of the suppliers/batches\ncontributing to the bulk). Therefore, where a trader receives individually traceable units of product (e.g. sacks of\nmaterial), each of which can be individually traced from supplier to customer, this does not count as a place of\nconsolidation.

In this\nsituation, the requirement to approve the processor, packer or consolidator is not applicable, as the requirements of\nthese Standards ensure that effective systems for supplier approval and traceability are in place.

    "interpretation_guidance": "Supply chain traceability It is important for the integrity of products that appropriate traceability systems operate\nthroughout the supply chain. Therefore sites must ensure that their raw material suppliers (including primary packaging\nsuppliers) have suitable traceability systems in operation. This assurance can be obtained from certification, auditing\nor by directly testing traceability. Examples of acceptable traceability include: - The raw material supplier is\ncertificated to a GFSI-benchmarked standard. Assessment of traceability systems forms part of these audits and\ntherefore no additional action is required to comply with the requirements of this clause; however, a communication\nmechanism should be in place, such that if the raw material supplier were no longer certificated, the site would be\nmade aware of this change. - The raw material supplier is audited by the site and the audit includes an assessment of\nthe traceability systems. This would comply with the requirement as traceability has been assessed. The audit should be\nrepeated at least every 3 years. - Verification of a supplier’s traceability system where approval has been based\nsolely on a questionnaire with no additional testing (unless the raw material is a primary agricultural product\npurchased directly from a farm or fishery, where additional testing of the traceability systems is not mandatory). This\nverification could include, for example: - A test of the raw material supplier’s traceability. For example, as part of\nthe site’s traceability test (see clause 3.9.3), a relevant ingredient is highlighted. The ingredient and batch details\nare forwarded to the supplier to enable them to complete the traceability test for the specific batch of raw materials\nand forward the relevant records back to the site. Interpretation continued - A worked example from the raw material\nsupplier, which clearly explains the traceability process. - A detailed description of the traceability system provided\nby the raw material supplier. Information received during the traceability verification should be incorporated into the\nsupplier approval process (clause 3.5.1.2). Where the supplier is not the manufacturer, packer or consolidator of the\nraw material (e.g. purchased from an agent, broker or wholesaler) and approval is based on a questionnaire instead of\ncertification or audit, the verification of the traceability system required by this clause shall be carried out on the\nlast manufacturer, packer or consolidator of the raw material. Therefore, where the: - agent/broker is certificated to\na BRCGS Standard or a standard benchmarked by GFSI, the assessment of supplier approval forms part of these audits and\ntherefore no additional action is required to comply with the requirements of this clause (see clause 3.5.1.5 for\nfurther information) - last manufacturer, packer or consolidator is certificated to a BRCGS Standard or a standard\nbenchmarked by GFSI, the assessment of supplier approval forms part of these audits and therefore no additional action\nis required to comply with the requirements of this clause - last manufacturer, packer or consolidator is audited as\npart of the supplier approval process, and the audit includes an assessment of the traceability systems, this would\ncomply with the requirement as traceability has been assessed. Traceability verification is a requirement for each raw\nmaterial supplier. Therefore any traceability test (because the supplier approval is based solely on a questionnaire)\nshould be designed to test the raw material supplier’s systems and not to trace every single material they produce.\nWhere a site purchases multiple ingredients from the same raw material supplier, it is not a requirement to complete a\ntraceability test for every single ingredient purchased; only to complete the traceability test for each supplier from\nwhich ingredients are purchased. The frequency of the traceability verification should link to the supplier approval\nprogramme; that is, the traceability is verified on first approval of the supplier, and then at least every 3 years. It\nis good practice to phase these verifications over the 3-year period rather than trying to complete them for all sites\nat once. Therefore sites that are new to certification (i.e. at their initial audit) may not have fully completed the\ntraceability assessment for all of their suppliers, but should be able to demonstrate verification of the traceability\nsystem for at least a third of the suppliers in the first year, prioritising the higherrisk materials; two-thirds\ncompleted within the second year; and all suppliers by the third year. During the BRCGS audit the auditor will not\nundertake a test of raw material suppliers’ traceability systems but they will review the site’s processes and the\ninformation received from its raw material suppliers. Issues arise with raw materials from time to time so it is\nbeneficial to consider the monitoring of any materials that may need further transparency within the supply chain. This\nensures that the site is proactive, not reactive, potentially mitigating the risk of future concerns about raw\nmaterials. 88 brcgs.com Clause Requirements"

This is particularly pertinent with packaging materials where print has been changed to reflect changed raw\nmaterials and, potentially, allergens. Good practice would ensure that approved packaging samples are supplied to the\ngoods-in team with the relevant part codes that can be visually checked by goods receipt staff.

    "interpretation_guidance": "Management of corrective actions There must be a documented procedure for handling issues in the food safety and\nquality system which have a potential adverse effect on product safety, authenticity, legality or quality. All issues\nor non-conformities generated by the site (e.g. non-conforming product, internal audits and site inspections,\nthird-party audits or customer complaints, product recalls, product testing (including inspections, quality assurance\ntests and laboratory testing)) must be subject to corrective action. Good practice is for corrective action to be\ncompleted as soon after detecting the nonconformity as possible (this is particularly important where the\nnon-conformity could affect product safety, legality or quality – see clause 3.7.2). An important part of an effective\ncorrective action process is the identification of the root or underlying cause of the non-conformity and the\nimplementation of suitable action to prevent recurrence. Root cause analysis is a process of conducting an\ninvestigation into an identified problem to allow the investigator(s) to understand the fundamental cause and put it\nright. While there are a number of techniques for undertaking root cause analysis, one of the most common and simplest\nto use is the ‘five whys’ technique. The technique is based on repeatedly digging deeper into the cause of a problem by\nasking ‘Why …?’ to get to the root of the issue. Usually, the root cause becomes evident after five steps, but this is\nnot fixed and further investigation should be completed where required. This is described in more detail in the example\nin clause 3.7.2. Some clauses in the Standard specifically require root cause analysis but it is up to the site to\nestablish a procedure for its completion. Root cause analysis procedures should include: - a set of parameters that\nwill initiate the use of an appropriate tool (i.e. the site must define when the analysis will be completed if it is\nnot already prescribed by the Standard) - who is trained and/or authorised to complete the analysis - the methods that\nthe site will use to conduct the analysis - the records which detail the analysis and any subsequent preventive actions\n- the methods for the verification of the completed actions. The auditor will expect to see a documented procedure that\nincludes this information, as well as evidence of any root cause analysis and preventive action that the site has\ncarried out. It is worth noting that in some geographies the analysis of trends may be a legal requirement. For\nexample, in the EU, the Microbiological Criteria for Foodstuffs (EC) No 2073/2005 states that food business operators\n(FBOs) shall analyse trends in test results. When they observe a trend towards unsatisfactory results, they shall take\nappropriate actions without undue delay to remedy the situation in order to prevent the occurrence of microbiological\nrisks."

Action needs\nto be undertaken as soon as possible after the detection of the nonconformity, but there may also be a need for\nlong-term action to prevent further occurrence of the non-conformity.

Where there is a significant trend in a specific type of non-conformity, root cause\nanalysis must be used to investigate the trend and implement action to prevent recurrence. All corrective actions\nshould be completed in a timely fashion. In practice this will depend on the nature of the activity and the potential\nconsequences of a delay. For example, stopping the production line would happen immediately but receiving and fitting a\nnew or replacement part may be a prolonged process. The actions should be included in a regular review of activities\nand systems. The site must assess the consequences of any delay in action and ensure that product integrity and safety\nare not jeopardised. Where set timescales are not met, the reason for the delay should be recorded and reviewed by the\nappropriate site management to ensure ongoing product safety and, where necessary, provide appropriate resources. 104\nbrcgs.com Clause Requirements Example Root cause analysis using the ‘five whys’ technique An operator is instructed to\nperform a simple action, ‘Weigh out ingredient A’. However, the operator inadvertently uses ingredient B instead. The\nimmediate reaction would probably be that this was operator error. Although this may be accurate, it does not establish\nthe reason why the error occurred or prevent it from happening in the future. Using the five whys technique, the root\ncause analysis should ask and answer a series of questions: - Why did the operator make the error? The operator was\nunfamiliar with the procedure. - Why was an operator who was unfamiliar with the procedure asked to complete it? He had\nbeen trained but there was no supervision or sign-off of the training to confirm it was satisfactory. - Why was the\ntraining not satisfactory? The two ingredients looked identical. - Why weren’t the ingredients clearly labelled? The\nlabels had been removed during cleaning and not replaced. - Why weren’t the labels replaced? The cleaning staff did not\nconsider the significance of the delay or the potential for an error. - Why were the ingredient containers being used\nif they had not been set up correctly for manufacture? Checking the labels did not form part of anyone’s duties. The\nconclusion of a root cause analysis should be to identify what should be changed to prevent recurrence of the error. In\nthis example, the conclusion might be to: - update the training procedure - introduce a training sign-off procedure to\nensure training is understood - replace labels – if practical, with ones that cannot be removed. Where labels must be\nremoved occasionally, ensure that post-maintenance line checks include a check of signage - ensure that an individual\n(e.g. the production manager) is authorised and responsible for post-cleaning line sign-off - ensure that cleaning\nstaff fully understand and are trained in the need to return labelling (and all equipment) to a fully operational\nstate. Now that the root cause analysis has been completed, it is easy to see how this incident occurred. The causes\nwere: - an incomplete training procedure - a faulty cleaning process - lack of post-cleaning check procedures. The next\nstep of the process is for the site to identify and implement suitable preventive action to ensure the problem does not\noccur again (where a non-conformity has multiple causes it is important that the preventive action addresses all of\nthese). For example: - update the training procedure to ensure sign-off ( and possibly a supervision step) - replace\ningredient labels ideally with ones that cannot be removed - if labels must occasionally be removed, ensure that\npost-cleaning line checks include a signage check - ensure an individual is authorised and responsible for\npost-cleaning line sign-off - ensure cleaners fully understand and are trained in the need to return labelling (and all\nequipment) in a fully operational state.

The limitations of any\nsystem must be recognised, as can be demonstrated by the problems associated with bulk storage. Products such as sugar\nmay be delivered with clear batch identification; however, if they are emptied into a single storage tank that is mixed\nwith earlier deliveries, the reduction in accurate traceability is compounded by the potential for product to be\ntrapped in dead zones during filling and emptying. If a particular delivery is identified as being contaminated, the\nentire product in the storage tank would need to be disposed of, as well as several lot codes of finished product, as\nthe company would not be able to identify the specific batch of finished product that contained the contaminated\nmaterial. A similar limitation will exist if recyclable packaging is collected from several sources and combined to\nform a single batch. 108 brcgs.com Clause Requirements Interpretation continued The traceability system needs to\ninclude primary packaging (a full definition of primary packaging is available in the glossary, Appendix 1). Note that\nprocessing aids (i.e. substances that are used within the process but are not required to be declared as an ingredient,\nsuch as sodium alginate for the clarification of beer) are included in the definition of raw materials (see glossary,\nAppendix 1) and therefore need to be included in the traceability system. All test results (clause 3.9.3) must be\ntraceable to specific batches of product or ingredient. Consider how the traceability system operates in practice (with\nthe effective physical identification of ingredients and products). For example, if bulk containers are labelled,\nconsider how the information is presented to ensure it is legible and accurate. Common non-conformities include the\nineffective labelling of part-used packs in production, work in progress, and storage areas leading to potential\nerrors. Strict controls on material identification, traceability and segregation are also required to preserve the\nintegrity of any claims made, such as organic status. Where logos are used that make specific claims about production\nsystems (e.g. farm assurance), full traceability must be demonstrated (see also section 5.4). Apart from batch or lot\ncodes, traceability information will usually include date codes to ensure that only ingredients, intermediates and\nproducts within the appropriate shelf-life period are used. Particular care is needed for decanted ingredients, work in\nprogress and products stored in bulk where the packaging has been removed."

The test\nshall occur at a predetermined frequency, at a minimum annually, and results shall be retained for inspection.\nTraceability should be achievable within 4 hours.",
    "interpretation_guidance": "Tests of the traceability system Good practice is for the site to have a procedure or document that highlights the\ntraceability system that is used at each step in the production process. It could include, for example, how incoming\nraw material batch numbers are captured, and how the outgoing product is traced and labelled. The process flow diagram\ndeveloped as part of the HACCP plan (see clause 2.5.1) may be useful to ensure all steps are captured. The site’s\ntraceability system must be tested at least annually, or more frequently if required by a customer. (Note that the\nfrequency of traceability tests relating to provenance and origin claims is covered separately in clause 5.4.5.) Where\ntraceability for all products manufactured by the site is the same or similar, then a minimum of one traceability test\na year must be completed. However, if there are significant differences or specific traceability challenges relating to\none product or group of products, additional tests specifically related to that product or group of products may be\nneeded. Traceability testing may be completed as part of a real product recall or withdrawal scenario if one has\noccurred, since the objective is to test the system and identify areas for improvement, rather than supply records of a\n‘test’ for its own sake. Interpretation continued The system must provide traceability forwards and backwards;\ntherefore the system should be tested in both directions. For example, a raw material could be selected and traced\nforwards to show in which finished products it was used. A finished product should also be selected and traced\nbackwards to show all the raw material batch codes (including primary packaging) that were used to produce it. The\ntests should include identifying which customers received the finished products and which suppliers provided the raw\nmaterials. The traceability test must also include the traceability of the primary packaging materials. Although there\nare many benefits to complete supply chain traceability (i.e. from the farm through all stages of processing,\ndistribution and storage, through to the retailer or food service company), this clause does not require sites to\ncomplete full supply chain traceability tests. The scope of the traceability test required here is from the suppliers\nof the raw material, through the site’s processes, to the site’s customers. The site is also expected to compile a\nsummary of the documents that should be referenced during the test, and clearly show the links between them. This is of\nbenefit to both the site and the auditor, as it ensures all relevant documents are retrieved, and explains the\ntraceability system. The test of traceability should be timed and full traceability would be expected to be achieved\nwithin 4 hours. This is to reflect the need for rapid traceability in the event of a recall. Where traceability takes\nlonger than 4 hours, review the areas where the retrieval of information is slow in order to identify improvements. For\nall food products, and printed packaging and labels which have product safety information, the tests must also include\na quantity check or mass balance exercise. It is not expected that the full mass balance exercise would always be\nachievable within 4 hours. The objective is to be able to account for the usage of a full batch of a raw material. This\nhelps to ensure that the traceability systems are capable of operating effectively should a product recall be required\nbased on the recall of an ingredient. The mass balance exercise is usually undertaken as follows: - Select a batch code\nof a particular specific raw material. - Identify the quantity of the raw material supplied under that batch code. -\nIdentify the recipes in which the ingredient is used. - Use production schedules and batch make-up sheets to calculate\nthe quantities of the selected batch of ingredient used in each product. - Calculate the quantity of any unused part of\nthe batch in the warehouse. - Reconcile the quantity delivered against the amounts used plus any residual unused stock.\nIn some instances quantity checks may take a great deal of time and resource to complete successfully. It is unlikely\nthat the mass balance exercise will be able to account for all materials to 100% accuracy. However, the company needs\nto justify any discrepancies and demonstrate understanding of the nature of the variance. This may be inherent in the\nproduct characteristics (e.g. dehydration of fresh ingredients), or be ascribed to typical wastage on equipment or\nportion variances. Where the site adds subsequent deliveries to a bulk silo, the test should clearly show how this has\nbeen managed. The principle is to ensure that the traceability system is effective. Mass balance is a key measure of\nits workability and highlights areas for improvement. 110 brcgs.com Clause Requirements Interpretation continued During\nthe BRCGS audit, the auditor will ask the site to complete at least one ‘vertical’ audit. At a minimum this will\ninclude the traceability of a specific batch of product or ingredient through the site’s production, processing and\ndistribution processes, and a review of the site records related to the product or ingredient. Records will include,\nfor example, supplier approval, goods receipt, process records (such as temperature monitoring), metal detector checks\nand dispatch records. However, the vertical audit is not expected to include records that would only be held at other\npoints in the supply chain (e.g. the raw material supplier’s processing records). This vertical audit is in addition to\nthe review of the site’s own traceability tests. The final audit report will include a summary of the vertical audit\nresults. The vertical audit will also include a mass balance exercise and a review of the systems relating to the\naccuracy of labelling (clause 5.2.1). Further information on the content of the audit, including the vertical audit,\ncan be obtained from BRCGS’ auditing techniques document. This may be viewed online at BRCGS Participate.

This includes an assessment of the production risk zones needed for the\nprevention of microbiological contamination. Full details of the definitions of the production risk zones recognised by\nthe Standard are given in Appendix 2 of the Standard. However, in summary, the Standard recognises six zones: -\nhigh-risk and high-care zones for chilled or frozen and ready-to-eat products where there is a risk of contamination -\nambient high care for products where there is a risk of contamination with vegetative micro-organisms originating from\nraw materials and the products are stored in ambient conditions (rather than chilled or frozen) - low-risk areas -\nenclosed product areas (e.g. storage areas where products are fully enclosed within packaging and production areas\nwhere the product is fully enclosed within the equipment or pipework) - non-product areas (i.e. areas such as offices,\nwhere products are not taken at any stage in their manufacture or storage). Interpretation continued It is important to\nnote that the high-risk, high-care and ambient high-care production zones usually only apply to part of a factory’s\nproduction processes. These zones typically start when products exit a microbiological kill step and include all the\nprocesses and steps until the products are enclosed in packaging.

Wherever possible,\nall facilities should be designed and positioned so that the movement of personnel is by simple, logical routes -\nroutes of movement for raw materials - routes of movement for the removal of waste - routes of movement for rework -\nthe location of staff facilities, including changing rooms, toilets, canteens and smoking areas - areas where time\nsegregation is used; in other words, where the same production area is used as both a high-care and a low-risk\nproduction zone at different times, with time segregation being used to separate the products with different risks (see\nAppendix 1 for definitions). Sites which have identified the need for high-risk, high-care or ambient high-care areas\n(see clause 4.3.1) will also need to include the location of the pathogen control step(s) on the map (see clause\n8.1.1).

Particular attention needs to be paid to the movement of personnel, raw materials, packaging, rework and\nwaste, to ensure that the routes taken are defined and product safety is not compromised. For example, the removal of\nunnecessary packaging, such as debagging or removing outer boxes, should take place in a designated area, usually prior\nto transfer to production areas, in order to avoid potential foreign-body risks from discarded packaging. The\nprocedures developed to ensure product safety must be documented and validated as effective, and the appropriate staff\nmust be trained.

The main risks to consider are: the carry-over of\nboiler water-treatment chemicals in steam; dust particles in compressed air; and oil used as a lubricant in\ncompressed-air systems. The level of monitoring needs to be based on an assessment of potential risk. Steam generated\nfrom potable water free from additives, for instance, is not likely to present a risk. Compressed air in direct contact\nwith products needs to be filtered prior to use, and the filters checked and maintained to ensure they remain\neffective. The gauge of filtration (e.g. mesh size) and frequency of checks should be documented and based on risk\nassessment, taking into account the source of the air, the type of compressors used and the condition of the pipework\n(e.g. evidence of corrosion). The compressor suppliers or experts should be consulted to establish any potential risks\nand any necessary testing. The objective of using filters is to prevent dust particles and lubricating oil from the\ncompression system contaminating the products. Therefore a single central filter, in close proximity to the compressor,\nbut remote from the food-related use of the compressed air, is unlikely to provide sufficient product protection. The\nsite must be able to justify the effectiveness of the filtration system employed. If gases are used, such as in\nmodified atmosphere packing, they must be demonstrated as being of an appropriate quality. Usually such gases are\nsupplied in a compressed form in metal cylinders and the supplier management process (approved suppliers and\nspecifications, with certificates of conformance if required) would be sufficient. In these circumstances, the site\nwould not be expected to undertake its own checks. Compressed gases are generally considered to be microbiologically\nsafe and the Standard does not require routine testing of such gases unless a specific risk has been identified. There\nmay be additional risks where gases are produced on site and these would need to be evaluated through a risk\nassessment. Additional information can be obtained from the British Compressed Air Society and the European Industrial\nGases Association."

    "interpretation_guidance": "Equipment purchase specifications The process for the purchase of new equipment must start prior to the actual purchase\nof the equipment, with an equipment purchase specification (sometimes referred to as user requirements). The aim of the\nclause is not to introduce onerous documentation for all equipment, but to ensure that new equipment meets the site’s\nneeds; for example, it is suitable for its intended use and is designed to eliminate or manage any identified food\nsafety hazards. Interpretation continued For the purposes of the Standard, new equipment can be defined as equipment\nbought directly from a manufacturer, second-hand equipment bought by the site (therefore new to the site) or equipment\nthat has been refurbished externally. It does not include small parts such as screws or other non-food contact fixings.\nPurchase specifications need to contain sufficient information to ensure product safety and suitability of the\nequipment. This means that the actual amount of detail in the purchase specification will be dependent on the type of\nequipment being purchased. For example, a simple plastic scoop is only likely to need a very simple set of user\nrequirements, with minimal food hazards identified, whereas a new production line is likely to require significantly\nmore details regarding, for example, product types, production rates and food contact requirements. Purchase\nspecifications usually include: - reference to any relevant legislation - requirements for food contact surfaces (i.e.\nwhere product will be in contact with the equipment) - intended use of the equipment - types of materials that will be\nused (this is particularly important for food contact surfaces, since potential migration from equipment may be\naffected by the composition of the food material, e.g. high fat or acidic materials can increase potential for\nmigration). Good practice is to consider who within the company can authorise the purchase of new equipment. For\nre-purchases of simple equipment, this may be simply a case of identifying who is authorised to order the product;\nhowever, for complex machinery (such as a new production line), there may need to be input from multiple departments,\nsuch as engineering, technical, hygiene and finance. This is to ensure that all critical food safety requirements have\nbeen considered and included within the specification. Note that where equipment is purchased from suppliers in other\nregions or countries, legislative requirements may vary, and additional communication of requirements may facilitate\nthe purchasing process. The site should retain evidence of the specification developed, and evidence provided from the\nsupplier demonstrating that the equipment meets these requirements, as this provides evidence of due diligence in the\nevent of a challenge or incident. During the BRCGS audit, the auditor will expect to see evidence of the purchase\nspecification for any new equipment, the specification’s suitability for the specific equipment, equipment purchase\nmatching the specification, and, as detailed in clauses 4.6.2–4.6.7, commissioning of equipment, hygiene requirements,\nroutine maintenance, etc. Note that the clause relates to the purchase of new equipment. It does not require a site to\nretrospectively develop specifications for equipment that was purchased prior to the publication of the Standard, or\nprior to its decision to become certificated for the first time."

    "interpretation_guidance": "Equipment in direct contact with food The aim of this requirement is to ensure that equipment is not a source of\nproduct contamination, and that it complies with relevant food contact legislation where such legislation exists (for\nexample, in the EU, the Food Contact Materials – Regulation (EC) 1935/2004 and its subsequent amendments). The clause\nprovides some examples of potential issues, including: - Food contact surfaces should be smooth and impervious; for\nexample, to prevent accumulation of material that could lead to microbiological or allergen contamination of the\nproduct. - Welds and joints should form a flat surface (again to prevent microbiological or allergen contamination).\nOther well-documented issues have included the purchase of equipment (especially plastic items) not designed for food\nuse leading to the migration of chemicals into food products. The company must consider the risks associated with the\nequipment (including any risks associated with its design, construction and installation) and ensure that significant\nrisks have been controlled. This can, for example, be achieved by use of a hygienic design risk assessment, which uses\nhygienic design principles to consider the risks of foreign-body, microbiological, allergen or chemical contamination\nof the product. Before using the equipment, the company will need to have evidence that the risks have been considered,\nand of the suitability of the equipment, and must confirm its acceptability for food contact surfaces. For new\nequipment, this will usually form part of the purchase specification process (see clause 4.6.1). Where such evidence is\nnot available (for example, when purchasing second-hand equipment) and the contact material is not a recognised\nfood-safe material (such as certain grades of stainless steel), an additional assessment should be carried out to\nensure safe use and to prevent food safety risks. The risk assessment should consider factors such as: - the nature of\nthe food contact surface and its known characteristics - the length of contact time with the food - the nature of the\nfood and its potential for contamination (e.g. fatty or acidic foods are often at increased risk from migration of\ncontaminants from plastic materials). During the BRCGS audit, the auditor will not inspect every seal, bolt or food\ncontact surface, but will: - need to understand the site processes; for example, they may review the documented process\nand their suitability, whether they have been used in practice, and the completeness of relevant records - inspect a\nsmall number of relevant examples of equipment where there is a food safety or quality implication; this may, for\nexample, be completed during the inspection of equipment hygiene (see clause 4.11.1)."

Using the previous example, a new plastic scoop is likely to require\nminimal commissioning, whereas a completely new production line is likely to require an extensive commissioning\nprocess. Therefore the commissioning procedure should be risk-based, allowing the site the flexibility to complete the\nappropriate activities for the specific equipment. Examples of commissioning activity might include installation and\nsign-off of equipment, trials operating the equipment, cleaning validation and maintenance checks. In order to\nfacilitate routine cleaning, operation, inspection and servicing, equipment must be appropriately positioned (e.g.\naccess provided under, inside and around it). Where equipment is permanently sited, it should be properly secured and\nsealed to the floor to prevent the accumulation of food debris underneath, where it cannot be cleaned. It has been well\ndocumented that, where equipment or fixtures allow organic matter and/or pathogens to collect and survive, this can\nsubsequently cause product contamination as pathogens such as Salmonella or Listeria can survive for prolonged periods\nin these conditions if left undisturbed.

In some low-risk operations, the\nhand-wash prior to entry to the production area may be in a changing facility or toilet rather than within the entrance\nto the actual production area. In some dry environments where water is avoided, gel or alcohol sanitisers may be used\nin the production areas in place of hand-washing facilities, although staff will still be required to wash their hands\nbefore entering the production area.

In the absence of specific legislative requirements and\nassessments for the control of hazards in catering facilities, a study based on HACCP principles should have been\ncarried out on any catering facilities provided for the staff. The risks identified should be effectively controlled –\nin particular, those associated with staff hygiene, cleaning, cross-contamination between raw and cooked foods, and\nstorage conditions. Where hot food is prepared within a site’s facilities, additional safe food-handling may be\nrequired; for example, the WHO’s Five Keys to Safer Food Manual promoting safe foodhandling highlights the need to: -\nkeep clean – wash hands and keep kitchens and food preparation areas washed and sanitised - separate raw and cooked\nfoodstuffs, and keep the utensils or equipment used for handling them separated - cook or reheat products thoroughly\n148 brcgs.com Clause Requirements Interpretation continued - store food at appropriate temperatures to maintain food\nsafety; for example, using fridges and freezers, and keeping cooked food hot before serving - use water of an\nappropriate quality to ensure that it is not the source of a food safety hazard. The Standard requires sites to\nconsider whether there are risks of product contamination from catering activities and vending machines, and, where\nappropriate, ensure that suitable company policies are in place to manage these risks. For example, in some operations\n(e.g. sites manufacturing a product with an allergen-free claim), specific allergens may present a particular risk.\nThese sites should specify any relevant company policies to confectionery vending suppliers and catering facilities. At\nthe BRCGS audit, there will be a basic inspection of the kitchen facilities. Catering facilities should be part of the\nsite’s own internal audit or hygiene inspection programme."

The\ndocumentation must include: - a list or register of items, detailing their location, number, type and condition. When\ncreating the list, it is important to be realistic; the objective is to remove brittle items where possible and create\na list of items for inspection which present a real risk of breakage and contamination of products (i.e. those that are\nin open product areas or where risk assessment shows there is a genuine risk to product). (The list could also detail\nthe frequency with which the items must be checked.) - recorded, routine inspections to verify the condition of these\nitems. Inspections must be carried out at a specified frequency based on risk assessment; some areas may be checked\nmore frequently than others because of their potential to form a foreign-body hazard in the product. (For example, a\nfactory identifies part of the production line which has plastic-laminated line covers that may chip or break. The\ncondition of this section of the line is specifically checked daily prior to production, because it is above open food\nand any breakage or damage is likely to result in a foreign-body issue. The same factory has a brittle plastic dial\ncover on a control panel on the exterior of a piece of equipment not close to open product. This is checked only\nmonthly, as a break and subsequent foreignbody issue is unlikely to arise.) - maintaining a record of the inspection\neven when there is no change in the condition of the inspected items. Any non-conformities highlighted in previous\ninspections, but not permanently repaired, should also be checked to confirm no additional deterioration has occurred -\nthe procedures that allow cleaning or replacement of items in a way that minimises potential risk to products (e.g.\nreplacing bulbs in fly-killing devices). Further guidance Developing an effective glass control programme To start\nwith, carry out an assessment of the glass and brittle plastic items in open product areas and, wherever possible,\nremove them (see clause 4.9.3.1). If the item cannot be removed, it must be protected against breakage (e.g. with\nadhesive sheets or reinforcements) and included on a register for inspection purposes (an example is shown in Figure\n15). When creating a list of items for inspection, it is important to be realistic. The objective is to create a list\nof items that represent a real risk of breakage and product contamination. For example, the window above the production\nline is likely to be high-risk, as any breakage is likely to contaminate the product. But the window in the Director’s\noffice, on the other side of the site, does not need to be included unless there is a genuine risk of product\ncontamination if the window breaks. Further guidance continued The frequency of the inspections must be based on risk\nassessment. The quality of the risk assessment is important as some items will probably be checked infrequently because\nof their lower risk status, whereas others may require frequent checks because of their prominent location and\nassociated risk. For example, checking the window above the production line is likely to form part of the daily line\nstart-up procedures. You must ensure you have a contingency procedure in place that allows the reporting and timely\nmanagement of any breakage (i.e. if an item is found to be damaged or broken during an inspection or if an item breaks\nduring use). There are a number of risk assessment techniques that can be used within food sites and the Standard is\nnot prescriptive about which should be selected. However, there are two key considerations in relation to glass and\nbrittle materials: - the potential for damage or breakage - the location and consequently the likelihood of a broken\nfragment contaminating a food product. The importance of good documentation and record-keeping Five key documents are\nrequired: - a list of items giving details of their location, number, type and condition - a risk assessment defining\nthe required frequency of checks - records of the routine inspections to verify the condition of these items (see\nexamples in Figures 16 and 17) - procedures that allow the cleaning or replacement of items in a way that minimises\npotential risk to products - a procedure for the management of any breakages (see clause 4.9.3.3). A record of the\nchecks must be maintained even when there is no change to the status of the item (see examples in Figure 16 and 17).\nThis is to demonstrate that the checks were made, so that in the event of a breakage you can be confident that the item\nwas intact at the previous scheduled inspection, allowing any investigation or action to focus on a defined time\nperiod.

The sensitivity of detectors must be specified and best practice applied, taking into account\nthe nature of the food, contamination characteristics, and the location and aperture size of the detector. For example,\nit is likely that metal detectors will be sensitive to ferrous, nonferrous and stainless steel test pieces, using test\nsizes according to industry best practice for the particular product type or customer requirements. Good practice is\nfor foreign-body detectors to have adequate security settings so that only authorised personnel can alter them. The\nStandard expects the detector and its location to be validated at set-up; for example, by adjusting the machine’s\nsensitivity using a range of typical products to establish the most sensitive practical setting which gives rise to\nconsistent rejection without false rejects.

Its absence would normally only be based on\nthe use of an alternative, more effective, method of protection (e.g. the use of X-ray, fine sieves or filtration).\nThere will, however, be situations where metal detection does not, on the basis of risk assessment, provide any\nsignificant additional protection to the consumer; for example, where whole pieces of fresh produce (e.g. potatoes) are\nbeing washed and packed, and any metal contamination would be obvious to the consumer prior to consumption. Where metal\ndetectors are not used, a risk assessment must be available to justify the reasons why. While complaint levels are a\nfactor in making a decision on the necessity for a metal detector, this evidence alone will not be sufficient\njustification for not using one. (For example, there may be instances of contamination which have not been reported by\nconsumers.) Any justification for the absence of metal detection should be based on the nature of the product, the risk\nto the consumer, and alternative controls in place at the site which prevent metal contamination. Cost alone is not\nsufficient reason. 164 brcgs.com Clause Requirements Interpretation continued In all circumstances where products are\nmanufactured to a customer’s specification, sites must comply with any customer requirement for metal detection of\ntheir products. The decision tree in Figure 18 provides further guidance on the need for metal detection equipment for\nproducts not packed into metallic containers. Where the product is packed into metal packaging, an effective\nalternative test method must be developed (e.g. X-ray or metal-detecting the product at the stage prior to packing, or\nthe use of magnets and product inspection).

Regardless of the design of\nthe metal detector, the objective of this clause is to ensure that rejected products are effectively removed and not\naccidentally re-introduced into the process flow. The Standard requires the use of automatic rejection devices\nincorporated into metal detection and X-ray equipment. The use of belt stop and alarm systems is considered by some to\npresent a greater risk of ‘rejected’ product being re-introduced into the process flow than automatic rejection systems\nwhere the product is positively rejected into a locked container. The Standard permits the use of either rejection\nmechanism providing there are sufficient controls in place to prevent implicated product being inadvertently placed\nback into the product flow. For belt-stop-style metal detector rejection systems, this will typically include the use\nof a container into which rejected product is placed, which is secured so that only authorised staff can remove the\nproduct (similar to the locked-box system used for automatic rejection systems). Where automatic rejection is not used,\nthe following additional controls should be considered to ensure that rejected product is effectively segregated and\nmanaged: - The removal of affected product should be restricted to trained, authorised staff. This may be supported by\nrestricting access to the product once the belt has stopped (e.g. by using a locked production line cover and\nauthorised key holders). - Rejected product may be marked, be destroyed or have its label removed to reduce the risk of\nre-introduction to the process flow. - The line restart should be restricted to designated personnel who must verify\nthe location of the ‘rejected’ product prior to restart (i.e. the control panel/button for restart is secure, locked or\nsecurity-coded). - A record should be made of each occasion when the belt stops in response to the detection of metal\nin a product.

For example, the clause requires: - completing tests at typical line operating speeds – to\nensure detection and rejection mechanisms operate correctly at intended line speeds - placing test pieces within\nproduct packs – to ensure product matrix or packaging does not adversely affect the metal detector - use of successive\ntest packs – to ensure the system can effectively detect and, if necessary, reject, products immediately after a pack\nhas been rejected. 168 brcgs.com Clause Requirements Interpretation continued Many modern designs of metal detector\n(and other foreign-body detection systems such as X-rays) have failsafe systems – that is, they monitor their own\nfunctions and raise an alarm (usually audible) if something stops working. For example, if a product rejection system\nis powered by compressed air and the air supply fails, this will sound the alarm immediately, allowing staff to\ninvestigate the fault, rather than waiting until the next metal detector check finds a problem. Where these systems\nexist, it is important to run occasional checks to ensure that the failsafe system itself is operating (e.g. that the\nalarm will sound if one of its functions fails). The Standard does not expect sites to purchase new metal detection\nequipment if there is no failsafe system on their current equipment. Within the procedure, consideration must be given\nto where the test pieces are located. To ensure that the least sensitive areas of the metal detector are able to detect\nthe piece, this is usually the centre of the metal detector aperture."

    "interpretation_guidance": "Documented cleaning procedures Documented cleaning and disinfection procedures must be in place to ensure consistent\nand effective cleaning and as a guide for training purposes. When documenting such procedures, an emphasis should be\nplaced on the processing equipment and food contact surfaces. The procedures must be in sufficient detail for the\ncleaning to be carried out to a consistently acceptable standard. In the majority of sites, good practice would\nnormally include six stages of cleaning: - remove gross debris (e.g. sweep or wipe) - rinse with water - wash with\ndetergent solution using hot water - rinse - dry - sanitise. Where equipment requires different levels of cleaning\n(e.g. between products, or between daily and weekly cleans), each requirement should be clearly detailed and specific\nto the item of equipment. These procedures need to be reviewed and updated whenever changes to the equipment and areas\nto be cleaned occur. In addition, a good cleaning instruction would include: - a unique method of reference that can be\nquoted on paperwork (e.g. cleaning records) - photographs of equipment, which are useful for identifying equipment and\nfor highlighting areas that are difficult to clean, or that form key check/verification points - the appropriate\nprotective clothing or equipment that should be worn when cleaning or handling cleaning chemicals. 174 brcgs.com Clause\nRequirements Further guidance Developing an effective cleaning procedure In order for cleaning to be effective, it is\nimportant that the procedures are designed for the specific item, area or site. A generic, off-the-shelf procedure\nprobably would not guarantee a sufficient standard of cleaning. For example, an identical work surface in an area\nhandling bakery products would need to be treated differently from one in a meat-handling area. This would need to be\nassessed during the development and risk assessment stage. The complexity of the process and equipment, the types of\nproduct manufactured, the ease with which debris can be removed, and the need to manage specific hazards (e.g. specific\nmicroorganisms or allergens) are also factors to consider. Developing a cleaning procedure can be done in a few simple\nsteps: - Step 1 Set the required standard of cleaning (clause 4.11.3) Consider legislation, customer requirements,\nindustry or category best practice, etc. The risk assessment should consider the prevention of contamination from\nprevious products, as well as address potential microbiological, chemical or allergen concerns. - Step 2 Develop draft\nprocedures (clause 4.11.2) Ensure all items, areas and equipment are defined and included within the procedures. Think\nabout the order of cleaning too, so that cleaned equipment is not re-contaminated by subsequent cleaning activity. -\nStep 3 Validate the draft procedures (clause 4.11.3) Use validation to confirm that the required standard of cleaning\n(Step 1) is met. The Standard requires that cleaning procedures which form part of a defined prerequisite (i.e.\nprocedures that are used to control a specific hazard such as allergen crosscontamination) must be validated to ensure\nthey are effective and deliver the intended level of cleaning. However, it is also good practice for all cleaning\nprocedures to be validated. - Step 4 Finalise procedures and associated documentation (e.g. cleaning records and\nsignoff) Keep records that show what type of cleaning was completed, when it was completed, who did it, and who checked\nthe cleaning and signed it off as acceptable (a requirement of clause 4.11.2). - Step 5 Train relevant staff (clause\n4.11.4). - Step 6 Complete ongoing monitoring and verification (clauses 4.11.2 and 4.11.5). When developing cleaning\nprocedures, it is often useful to remember: - All equipment and areas must be included. - Cleaning needs should be\ndiscussed with equipment and chemical suppliers, who can often provide valuable assistance in identifying suitable\ncleaning materials. - Validation and verification are needed for cleaning activities – validation before introducing\nthe new procedure, and verification on an ongoing basis. Verification is the application of checks or tests, at regular\nintervals, to ensure the cleaning procedure is still working and continues to deliver the required level of cleaning.\nVerification of cleaning may include internal audits, record reviews, swabs or tests of the cleaned equipment, and the\nassessment of staff to ensure they have a clear understanding of the cleaning procedure. Further guidance continued -\nCleaning procedures should be reviewed whenever there are changes to the area, equipment or processes, including the\nintroduction of new products or the use of new ingredients. Example of a cleaning record In addition to cleaning\nprocedures, the Standard also requires records of the cleaning completed. As shown in Figure 19, records for routine\ncleaning generally include: - what was cleaned - who completed the cleaning - when the cleaning was completed -\nmonitoring, sign-off or confirmation that appropriate cleaning has been completed to a satisfactory standard.

Cleaning\nchecks should include hard-to-reach locations as well as surfaces and those locations that are easy to reach,\neffectively confirming satisfactory cleaning of all surfaces and areas. Where results are outside of the acceptable\nlimits, the site’s procedures should ensure that corrective action is taken (e.g. by repeating the cleaning process and\nrechecking the standard of cleaning). The exact action will depend on the type of cleaning, the check methodology and\nthe acceptable levels that have been defined."

    "interpretation_guidance": "The aim of the environmental monitoring programme is to develop a proactive, preventive monitoring programme that will\nidentify and eliminate sources of environmental micro-organisms (e.g. pathogens and spoilage organisms) in production\nand open product areas of the site, and facilitate timely and effective corrective action in the event of a risk being\nidentified (i.e. prevent the environmental micro-organisms from becoming the source of product contamination which\ncould lead to non-conforming product, a customer complaint or other incidents). An effective programme can, for\nexample, be used to: - confirm the effectiveness of cleaning and hygiene activities and identify any areas that require\nfurther activity - prevent product contamination by acting as an ‘early warning’ – identifying potential contamination\nfrom the site facilities before they affect products. The design and structure of this programme will depend on the\nnature of the products being handled and the potential hazards associated with them. The requirements are expected to\napply to all sites with: - open product areas - ready-to-eat products - products that are both processed in open\nproduct areas and ready-to-eat. Sites are not expected to ‘opt out’ of this requirement by determining that they have a\nlow-risk product or environment; completion of a risk assessment (clause 4.11.8.1) should only be used to identify\nrelevant hazards, suitable monitoring techniques and appropriate monitoring frequencies. There are, however, a small\nnumber of products which are inherently safe from these contaminants (e.g. because the product’s intrinsic properties\ndo not support the growth or survival of pathogens or spoilage organisms) and there is no opportunity for\nspoilage/pathogen contamination, and therefore an environmental monitoring programme may not be required. Where a site\nbelieves that this is not required, this belief must have a strong foundation in science and not be used to prevent\ngood practices. Therefore it is expected that: - all sites with high-risk, high-care or ambient high-care operations\nwill have an environmental monitoring programme within the relevant open product areas - environmental monitoring will\nbe applicable to other products, as there have been a number of very high-profile food poisoning outbreaks associated\nwith products not conventionally considered as high risk or high care (for example, cantaloupe melons, peanut butter,\nchocolate and milk powder), where environmental monitoring may have been effective in identifying an issue early.\nSimilarly, shelf-life issues such as mould contamination of bakery products may be reduced by suitable monitoring.\nWhere a site believes environmental monitoring is not required due to the absence of risk from pathogens and spoilage\norganisms, the site must prove this absence of risk. As a minimum, the site will have a robust risk assessment which\nconsiders: - both spoilage organisms and pathogens - the complete product range at the site. 182 brcgs.com Note that\nthis risk assessment must be more than a history of product testing – it must demonstrate an absence of risk. Suitable\ntechniques include pathogen modelling, challenge testing and published literature from a reputable source demonstrating\nthat pathogens cannot survive or grow. Examples of products where risk assessment may establish that environmental\nmonitoring is not required include: - alcoholic beverages and vinegars with a sufficiently high level of alcohol or\nacid to prevent survival and growth - salt and sugar in their dry ‘pure’ form - edible oils with no added ingredients -\nfully enclosed production. For example, at a specialist HPP (high-pressure processing) facility, where product is\nreceived packed, is processed in its packaging and leaves the site in the same packaging - whole vegetables, sold\nunwashed. Auditors will challenge the basis of any risk assessment to make sure this has properly considered likely\nissues and is demonstrably based on robust science. The requirements for environmental monitoring indicate that the\nsite’s environmental monitoring programme must be risk-based, therefore the food safety plan/HACCP may indicate risks\nthat should be monitored. Risks may include pathogens and/or spoilage organisms (such as yeasts or moulds), and the\nsite should consider whether it is more suitable to monitor the risk directly or via indicator organisms. Well-known\nexamples of pathogens and spoilage organisms that may be applicable to a site’s environmental monitoring include: -\nListeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat products, including those which are chilled and frozen. Alternatively, some\nsites monitor Listeria spp. and only examine the species if adverse positive results are obtained - Salmonella and/or\nEnterobacteriaceae in dry environments where susceptible products are handled - yeasts and/or moulds: these are\nwidespread spoilage organisms which may be of greater relevance for some product types. For example, products such as\njam are heated to a temperature that will kill many bacterial contaminants, are hot-filled, and have a low water\nactivity and low oxygen content. Consequently, the risk of pathogen growth is limited. However, there are yeasts and\nmoulds that can cause spoilage in these conditions, and therefore manufacturers must ensure that packaging, food\ncontact surfaces and the environment are monitored to minimise the risk of contamination.

Rapid on-site and laboratory\ntests are available, and sites should consider the requirements of section 5.6 when deciding which methods and/or\nlaboratories to use. Where knowledge is not available on site, the site may need to obtain guidance; for example, from\nan accredited laboratory - recording and evaluation of results.

These should be clearly identifiable (e.g. by colour-coding) - allergens that can form fine\npowders (e.g. flour, milk powder and soya isolates). The movement of airborne dust should be minimised by, for example,\nusing physical barriers (such as shrouds, lids or segregated areas) for dispensing and mixing operations. The location\nof air-conditioning outlets or the use of fans should also be considered to ensure these do not distribute airborne\nallergens - waste handling and spillage controls. Allergens should be removed efficiently, ensuring that the removal\nprocess does not become the source of allergen contamination in other areas of the factory - the allergens that may be\nhandled in non-production areas of the site (e.g. in canteens or in new product development).

Therefore, specific cleaning procedures must be present on site where allergencontaining materials require\ncontrol. Cleaning procedures must be designed to remove or reduce to acceptable levels any allergenic material. They\nmust consider: - cleaning schedules (i.e. when cleaning will be completed) - scheduling sufficient time to fully\ncomplete the clean to the required standard - ensuring that cleaning instructions contain all the information required\n- the order in which cleaning must be performed (to ensure that cleaning does not move an allergen into a previously\ncleaned area) - the cleaning equipment used for cleaning allergenic materials, which must not be a source of\ncontamination and must therefore be either dedicated for the removal of that allergen, single use or effectively\ncleaned after use. There is no internationally recognised definition of acceptable allergen levels; this would be\ndependent on the intended country of sale. For example, reference doses are being discussed in the EU (further\ninformation can be found on the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment’s website). Where multiple allergens are\nhandled on site, consider whether all allergens could be managed by the same cleaning/validation/verification\nactivities. For example, peanuts, milk and sesame seeds may need different controls because of their different physical\ncharacteristics. They may also be used on different equipment and production lines, again requiring separate\nconsideration. The effectiveness of the procedures must be validated. The validation must be documented and evidence\nwill typically include: - worst-case production/cleaning trials, where all equipment, processes and allergens need to\nbe considered Interpretation continued - targeted test locations, such as food contact surfaces, difficult-to-clean\nareas, deadlegs etc. - targeted samples, where worst-case samples are identified for laboratory testing using suitably\nsensitive test methods. (Validation tests should be accredited methods and, wherever possible, quantifiable. Rapid\ntests, ATP and lateral flow devices are good for verification activities but are not suitable for validation.) Possible\nsamples include the first product manufactured in the next production run, rinse water from cleaning systems, swabs\netc. - assessment of new equipment for ease of cleaning prior to purchase - positive testing of the test method used,\nto confirm that it will detect the allergen if it is present in a real sample (i.e. confirmation that product matrix\nwill not interfere with the test). It is likely that validation data will need to be collected from several production\nruns to ensure it is representative and complete. A number of bestpractice guidelines have been published on the\nvalidation of cleaning (e.g. Campden BRI Guideline 59 – Validation of Cleaning to Remove Food Allergens). The cleaning\nprocedures must be routinely verified by, for example: - visual inspections and documented sign-off - inclusion in\ninternal audits - the use of swabs or testing (e.g. rapid tests, ATP, lateral flow devices or laboratory tests).\nRecords must be maintained of validation and verification tests and activities. Any corrective actions must also be\nrecorded and completed. BRCGS has a training course on validation and verification. Further information is available on\nthe BRCGS website."

    "interpretation_guidance": "Vulnerability assessment A vulnerability assessment is a search for potential weaknesses in the supply chain in order\nto prevent food fraud (i.e. to prevent the adulteration or substitution of raw materials before they arrive at the\nsite). It is a specialised form of risk assessment, and needs a systematic and structured approach to ensure data\ngathering, identification of significant food fraud hazards, assessment of likelihood of occurrence, and identification\nand implementation of controls to mitigate genuine risks. The aim of the assessment is not to assess the potential for\nfraud at the site, but to examine the supply chain for potential concerns or weaknesses, thereby identifying those raw\nmaterials that are at particular risk of adulteration or substitution, so that appropriate controls can be put in place\n(clause 5.4.4). The vulnerability assessment will consider information relating to each ingredient in order to assess\nwhether there is a potential for food fraud. Where a site purchases a number of similar raw materials, it may be\npossible to consider these as a group rather than each raw material individually, providing the risks are similar. The\ncompany will need to ensure that all food materials are subject to a vulnerability assessment. Typical information to\nincorporate into the assessment includes: - any emerging issues and information identified in clause 5.4.2 - historical\nevidence of substitution or adulteration of the ingredient - cost/value of the material - availability (e.g. a poor\nharvest may restrict availability and may increase the potential for adulteration) - sophistication of routine testing\nto identify adulterants. If testing within the supply chain is comprehensive and specifically focused on potential\nfraud issues, then the likelihood of adulteration is reduced (e.g. fruit juice is often tested for a comprehensive\nrange of parameters, including DNA, isotopic analysis, added sugars and added water to prevent potential fraud)\nInterpretation continued - country of origin - length and complexity of the supply chain - supply chain model -\ncontrols that are already in the supply chain. For example, if the raw material supplier is certificated to the\nStandard, then as part of that certification the supplier must have completed its own vulnerability assessment, and\nthere is no requirement in the Standard for the site to duplicate its supplier’s vulnerability assessment. The nature\nof the raw material may change the potential for food fraud. For example, if a slaughterhouse is purchasing cattle,\nhorses and pigs for slaughter, it will be obvious if there is an issue with the live animals; however, if the\nslaughterhouse intends to make a claim such as organic, Aberdeen Angus or specified country of origin, then greater\ncontrols of raw materials will be required to ensure only those which meet the claim are purchased. Similarly, prepared\ningredients such as beef mince or ground spices are likely to have a greater risk than the whole ingredient. The\nStandard does not define the exact process that the site must follow when completing the vulnerability assessment;\nhowever, it is likely to incorporate the following steps: - draw up a list of raw materials (or groups of raw\nmaterials) and the controls (e.g. product testing, traceability systems or supply chain audits) that are already in\noperation - consider the information obtained from clause 5.4.2 for each ingredient - complete a risk assessment on the\nvulnerability of each ingredient. Note that the Standard does not require full supply chain mapping for all raw\nmaterials, although this may be a useful tool where a risk assessment indicates that a genuine risk exists and there is\na need to identify the point in the supply chain where an effective control can be applied. The output of the\nvulnerability assessment must include a documented vulnerability assessment plan which should rank or score the\nmaterials to identify those which need additional controls. The ranking and actions required could, for example, be as\nfollows: - Very high A high-profile raw material with recent reports of adulteration published by regulatory\nauthorities. Action or monitoring is required to ensure only genuine materials are purchased - High A high-profile\nmaterial that provides an attractive target for potential adulteration. Some action and/or monitoring is required to\nensure only genuine materials are purchased - Low This material is unlikely to be a target for substitution or\nadulteration; however a reassessment may be necessary if new information becomes available - Negligible No further\naction required as the material is extremely unlikely to be a target for food fraud. As mentioned earlier in this\ninterpretation, situations relating to food fraud change, and it is therefore important that the company has a dynamic\nsystem that can react to and assess new information as it becomes available, thereby ensuring the vulnerability\nassessment remains up to date. At a minimum, the vulnerability assessment must be reviewed at least annually and when\nthere is a significant change to the ingredient. As a guide, a review may be triggered by the following, although this\nis not an exhaustive list: 220 brcgs.com Clause Requirements Interpretation continued - a change in the country of\norigin or the supplier of raw materials - a change in the financial situation of raw material suppliers or countries of\norigin - a change in cost of raw materials, either upwards or downwards - a change in the supply chain, logistics and\ndelivery of materials - a change in material availability (e.g. because of seasonal shortages) - emergence of a new\nrisk (e.g. known adulteration of an ingredient) - developments in scientific information associated with ingredients,\nprocess or product - information received as part of a supplier approval or raw material risk assessment (e.g. clause\n3.5.1.1) which highlights new or evolving risks. A number of risk assessment tools have been published. These include\nsome specialist vulnerability assessment tools such as CARVER + Shock and TACCP (threat assessment and critical control\npoints), which may be used to achieve a structured approach to the assessment process. BRCGS has published a number of\nitems to assist with vulnerability assessments. These include a specific vulnerability assessment guideline that can be\nobtained from the BRCGS Store or viewed online at BRCGS Participate, and a training course available through BRCGS\nPerformance Enhancement and its global network of approved training providers. A number of organisations have produced\ntools to assist with food fraud and vulnerability assessments, including, for example, the Food Fraud Resilience\nSelf-Assessment Tool available on the UK FSA website."

Such a claim may be made either on\nthe product label for the consumer or in business-to-business communication. The types of claim include: - varietal\nclaims (e.g. basmati rice, Aberdeen Angus beef, Bramley apples and cod fish cakes) - origin claims (e.g. Madagascan\nvanilla and Florida grapefruit) - assurance claims (e.g. GLOBALG.A.P., Red Tractor, Marine Stewardship,\ndolphin-friendly tuna and sustainable palm oil) - identity-preserved claims (e.g. GMO-free). Claims which relate to the\ncomposition of the product (e.g. nutritional claims, fat-free, reduced sugar, free-from) are covered in clauses 5.3.7\nand 5.4.7. It is the responsibility of the site to make reasonable checks to ensure that the raw materials supplied are\ngenuine and that claims made about ingredients are proven. For many assurance schemes, such as GLOBALG.A.P., it is\npossible to check the assurance status and the scope of products of the supplier on a database. Reliance solely on a\ndeclaration from a supplier will not be sufficient. Where claims relate to variety or species (e.g. varieties of\nfruit), examination of visual characteristics may suffice. However, for claims where visual analysis is not possible\n(e.g. block frozen fish), certificates of analysis and periodic sample analysis will be required. Full traceability\nrecords must be maintained, as required in section 3.9. The records must also include details of the quantities\npurchased and amounts used at each step to enable a mass balance exercise to be undertaken. In the absence of more\nfrequent requirements relating to a particular scheme, the site must undertake a mass balance traceability exercise on\ntypical products for which a claim is made at least every 6 months. This must ensure that the system of records\nmaintained enables all finished product batches to be identified for a particular batch of raw materials and that, for\na given finished product, the batch(es) of raw materials used for its production can be identified. The test must be\ncarried out in both directions. 222 brcgs.com Clause Requirements Interpretation continued The ingredients selected for\nthe mass balance exercise must include the ingredient for which a claim is made. The objective is to test the systems\nand, where necessary, make improvements to information recording to allow claims to be substantiated should they be\nchallenged by a customer or legal authority. It follows that, where very different traceability systems are used\nwithin, for example, a complex or multi-product site, more than one mass balance traceability exercise may be required\nevery 6 months to ensure that all systems are working effectively. However, where a site has multiple claims, it is not\nintended that every claim be mass balance tested every 6 months but that a representative selection of claims are\nchosen. In this situation, good practice would be to choose different claims or products each time the test is\nconducted. The use of a third-party mass balance exercise (e.g. by an organic certifier or by the Fairtrade Foundation)\nwould be acceptable evidence of a test, providing that records of the test, the results and evidence of any necessary\nimprovements made as a result of the test are maintained. Where the third-party scheme measures the mass balance over a\nperiod (e.g. 1 month) rather than for a single batch code this is considered acceptable providing the requirements\ndiscussed above are met. If, as part of the requirements for a particular scheme or to use a logo, there is a\nrequirement for more frequent mass balance traceability exercises, then that scheme’s requirements must be met."

For example, an on-pack claim that a product is plant-based or vegetarian would\nneed to be validated, and this may include: - inclusion of the claim in raw material risk assessment, supplier approval\nand specifications - inclusion of the claim in the food safety plan, e.g. use of the process flow (see below) leading\nto specific controls such as segregation and dedicated equipment, or validated cleaning regimes - review of the\nproduction processes, equipment segregation etc. Good practice is to ensure that a programme of ongoing verification\nand monitoring is in place to demonstrate that claims are consistently met.

    "interpretation_guidance": "Compliance with legislative requirements There have been incidences of product recalls which have resulted from a lack\nof communication between the supplier of the packaging materials and the food manufacturer, typically where a packaging\nmaterial has been used in extreme product conditions or where packaging not designed for direct food contact has been\nused (e.g. a plastic liner of a carton is removed or changed to reduce costs). The company must be able to demonstrate\nthat each item of product packaging meets legal requirements for its use (e.g. compliance with food contact regulations\nin the country of sale). This may be in the form of specifications, migration data or a certificate of conformity.\nWhere a declaration of conformity is used, any limitations on usage must be stated (e.g. the food types or storage\nconditions: ambient, chilled or frozen). The supplier of the packaging must be made aware of the conditions under which\nthe packaging is going to be used, so that the suitability of the packaging materials can be confirmed. This may take\nthe form of a specification provided to the packaging supplier and would include, as appropriate: - contact with food –\ndirect food contact or, where not used for direct food contact, the nature of the barrier layer - characteristics of\nthe food – any adverse characteristics of the food which may increase migration of chemicals from the packaging (e.g.\nhigh fat content, or low or high product pH) - conditions of processing (e.g. high-temperature fill, thermal processing\nin pack, or freezing) - expected customer usage (e.g. microwave in pack, cooking in pack, or freezing) - use of\nrecyclable or reusable packaging materials - other packaging, especially where the components will be supplied by\ndifferent companies and there is a need for compatibility between the component parts (e.g. a bottle and cap\nmanufactured and supplied by different suppliers). Direct food contact materials are of most concern as these have the\ngreatest potential for harm and many geographical regions have specific legislation around direct contact packaging.\nHowever, there may be risk associated with the additional layers of packaging, particularly labelling which often\ncomprises the primary pack (consumer unit) and also secondary packaging such as corrugated cases. Physical or chemical\ncontamination can occur from these packaging components. Discussions with the provider of packaging materials are\nimperative to ensure that the right materials in the right configurations are used (e.g. it may be necessary to use\nlower levels of recycled content in a corrugated case for products that are susceptible to chemical migration).\nExtensive work at the start of the process is incredibly valuable and can prevent costly errors from being made in\nspecifications. Interpretation continued It is also vital to consider the product supply chain to establish the most\nappropriate packaging, given the storage and distribution conditions that the product will be subjected to. The\nrequirement allows some flexibility in the approach used; for example, a site could use risk assessment to identify the\nappropriate controls, and establish the level of evidence that is satisfactory for the level of risk (although the site\nwould need to ensure that any legal requirements were addressed). For example, in the EU the site may decide that it\nneeds to review an EU Declaration of Compliance (DoC) for Food Contact Materials due to a perceived risk of migration.\nThe site would need to demonstrate that the evidence available is appropriate for the level of risk associated with the\npackaging – it would not be acceptable to list the clause as ‘not applicable’, as there should also be evidence that\nthe matter has been adequately communicated/discussed with the packaging supplier. BRCGS has published a guideline on\nmigration from packaging materials into food, which may be purchased from the BRCGS Store or viewed online at BRCGS\nParticipate."

The HACCP or food safety plan is likely to identify some of the tests required and their\nfrequency. However, other tests which ensure the quality of the product and which may not have been included in\nassessments of product safety must be considered. For example, tests may be identified to: - monitor for a potential\ncontaminant (e.g. pesticides, heavy metals or microbiological contamination) - test for conformity to a specification\nor claim (e.g. nutritional content) - monitor trends (e.g. environmental monitoring of the site environment – see\nsection 4.11.8 for full details) - confirm compliance with a customer’s quality requirements - monitor potential food\nfraud or food defence concerns (e.g. as an output from food defence or food fraud assessments – see sections 4.2 and\n5.4). The processes for obtaining product samples, including, where necessary, their delivery to a laboratory, must be\nconsidered and will be dependent on the production process, the type of product, and whether the test is completed on\nsite or at an external laboratory. For example: - how the sample is removed from the production flow – identifying the\ncorrect product, preventing contamination of the rest of the production, confirming the correct quantity is taken -\nsample integrity – to ensure that the sample is fit for analysis; for example, protecting it from contamination or\nadverse treatment (e.g. maintaining appropriate product temperature and respecting any time limitations for chilled or\nfrozen products prior to microbiological testing) - clear labelling of samples with relevant information, including\ntraceability - where required, procedures for: - storage of samples before testing - delivery to a laboratory - clear\ncommunication with the laboratory.

The use of graphs or charts of test results\nprovides a good method of identifying trends and anomalous results. Wherever testing is carried out, criteria (e.g.\nacceptable limits, action limits or legal limits) shall be established and documented, so results can be interpreted.\nIt is important that the receiving site understands the test results and the content of any test report and can\ninterpret their significance. Where test results are found to be outside established limits, there must be clear\nprotocols on the actions to be taken (e.g. product hold, additional testing, customer notification, product withdrawal\nor recall). Appropriate actions should be implemented promptly to address unsatisfactory results or trends and thus\nprotect consumer safety, product quality, legality and brand reputation. Records of the results, review and any actions\ntaken should be maintained. The site must agree with the laboratory on how the measurement uncertainty shall be applied\nto results (for some tests, in some countries, this may be defined by legislation). Measurement uncertainty Measurement\nuncertainty (sometimes simply referred to as ‘uncertainty’) is a parameter associated with the result of a quantitative\nmeasurement. It is defined as the range of the values that could reasonably be expected for the attribute (e.g. the\nmicro-organism, allergen or chemical) being measured. It is sometimes known as the ‘margin of doubt’ of the result.\nMeasurement uncertainty is important when making conformity decisions (i.e. assessing whether a test result is within\nlegal, safety or acceptable limits), as the range of probable values may cross one of these limits. No matter what\nmethod is used, it will be subject to challenges inherent in taking the measurements accurately, day-to-day variations\n(e.g. in equipment, reagents, personnel or environmental conditions), and any systematic errors, random errors or\ncorrections associated with the test; therefore the result obtained is the best estimate of the value. Random errors\nare errors that fluctuate due to the unpredictability or uncertainty inherent in the measuring process, or the\nvariation in the quantity being measured (i.e. variation throughout the sample or product being tested, and this is\noften demonstrated by the normal variation seen in replicate measurements of the same material). A systematic error is\none that originates from a persistent issue and leads to a consistent error in the measurements; for example, recovery.\nMeasurement uncertainty continued Product testing is often completed to establish compliance with limits; i.e. to\ndemonstrate that a product meets the requirements defined in its specification, by regulations and by customers.\nKnowing the measurement uncertainty is important when making these conformity decisions. For illustrative purposes\nonly, in Figure 20, the horizontal line represents the target value or limit; values above this fall outside the\npermitted range, and values below it are within the permitted range. A B C D Figure 20 Example of the possible effects\nof measurement uncertainty Results A and D are well above or well below the limit, and thus applying the measurement\nuncertainty value will not change the conformity statement made (e.g. A is still outside the limit and D is still in\nspecification). It is in results B and C where measurement uncertainty would impact on the conformity. The value\nobtained for C is within the limit. However, if the result and measurement uncertainty are combined, the value\nrepresented by C may fall above the limit and thus be out of specification. The value obtained for B is above the limit\nand therefore would be out of specification, but taking measurement uncertainty into consideration, there is a\npotential that B could fall below the threshold (i.e. be within specification). Applying measurement uncertainty in\nthis manner needs careful consideration and justification depending on the risk, applicable legislation or customer\nrequirements. Where the test is of a critical parameter (e.g. product safety or legality), measurement uncertainty must\nnot be used to prevent taking the correct action to protect consumers and/or maintain legality."

The Standard includes\nsome common examples of equipment parameters such as: - heat distribution in retorts, ovens and processing vessels –\nthe Standard expects heatdistribution studies to be carried out on cooking equipment wherever small variations in\nprocess temperature may affect the safety of the products. Heat-distribution studies of a static oven may identify cold\nspots.

Temperature distribution studies would not normally be\nnecessary for small chill or cold stores where product is stored only for short periods.

The site must document its personal hygiene requirements. At\na minimum, these must include: - Watches are not permitted in open product areas (including devices used for fitness\nmonitoring and tracking). It is good practice to include details for all portable personal 258 brcgs.com Clause\nRequirements Interpretation continued items within site policies; for example, mobile phones and tablet devices (e.g.\nthe site might exclude all individuals’ personal mobile phones, but have specific rules relating to company-issued\nequipment, which could, for example, include instructions for cleaning on entry to production areas). - Jewellery must\nnot be worn apart from plain, smooth rings or wristbands (i.e. without stones that may fall out), such as wedding\nrings. Exceptions must be minimal and must not constitute a risk to product (e.g. wristbands identifying a particular\nmedical condition, such as epilepsy or an allergy, may be worn where product is not at risk of contamination). Where\nreligious reasons prevent the removal of an item of jewellery, it must be covered and the site must complete a risk\nassessment to determine how this will be achieved (e.g. by totally covering the item with the wearer’s clothing, or by\nwearing overalls that are buttoned up to cover the item). - The potential for broken, damaged or lost glasses and\ncontact lenses to become a foreignbody risk should be considered. - Rings and studs must not be worn in exposed parts\nof the body such as ears, noses, eyebrows and tongues. - Long fingernails are not permitted, as they are a\ncontamination hazard since they may break off; nor are nail varnish, nail art or false nails. Fingernails must be kept\nclean, commensurate with the level of hygiene expected within a food manufacturing environment. Where visitors cannot\ncomply with these rules, other controls (such as limiting where visitors may enter and what they may touch, and the\nobligatory use of gloves) must be implemented to minimise the risk of contamination. - Excessive perfume or aftershave\nmust not be worn, as this has the potential to taint foods. These requirements are applicable to raw-material handling,\npreparation, processing, packing and storage areas. The requirements for staff working solely in enclosed product areas\nmay be relaxed where no risk is presented to the products. The requirements must be communicated to all personnel (e.g.\nthrough induction training and sign-in procedures for visitors and contractors). Consideration must be given to the\nlanguage in which the training is completed; for example, where employees will be working in their second or third\nlanguage. Appropriate methods of training (e.g. use of translators) must be provided for them.

    "interpretation_guidance": "Hand-washing Hand-washing must be conducted at a frequency appropriate to the level of risk to the product being\nproduced and in line with good industry practice. At a minimum, hands must be washed before staff enter the production\narea and whenever an activity is undertaken that could potentially be a risk to products (e.g. after going to the\ntoilet, eating, smoking, blowing noses, sneezing or handling shoes). Appropriate instructions for hand-washing,\nconsidering the language needs of staff (e.g. including pictorial instructions), must be provided (clause 4.8.4).\nFurther guidance Introduction to hand-washing techniques Hand-washing is recognised as an effective way to reduce the\nrisk of contaminating food with micro-organisms such as E. coli, Salmonella and Staphylococcus aureus. However, a\nnumber of studies have shown that people either do not wash their hands or fail to clean them effectively. So it is\nvital that food companies not only provide staff with appropriate facilities to wash their hands but also ensure staff\nare aware of the correct procedure to follow. What makes a good hand-washing procedure? Frequency Hand-washing should\nbe carried out as often as is appropriate for the level of risk to the product. At a minimum hands should be washed: -\nbefore entering production areas - after any break which involves leaving the production area - after going to the\ntoilet - after eating or smoking - after blowing your nose. See also clause 8.4.1 for hand-washing facilities and\nprocedures in high-risk and high-care zones. Method There are a number of steps in an effective hand-washing procedure:\n- wet hands with water - apply soap - rub the hands so that all the parts of the hands are cleaned, including palms,\nbacks of hands, between fingers, backs of fingers, thumbs and fingertips - rinse hands to remove soap - dry hands\nthoroughly, as careful drying is a vital step in preventing the contamination of food products. For a pictorial example\nof best practice for hand-washing, visit the World Health Organization’s ‘How to Handwash?’ page. In addition to the\nabove routine, good practice is to apply a sanitiser such as an antibacterial hand gel after the hands have been washed\nand dried. An effective hand-washing routine should take approximately 40–60 seconds to complete. Training It is\nimportant that a good hygiene culture operates within the site so that an effective hand-washing routine becomes\nnormal, everyday behaviour. This means that all new staff should be trained (e.g. during induction training) in the\nsite’s hand-cleaning procedures and understand the importance of them. Regular updates can help ensure the information\nremains fresh in people’s minds.

The Standard allows\nhome laundering of protective clothing by employees, but only in exceptional circumstances, where both of the following\nconditions are met: - protective clothing is not used for product safety purposes, but is instead used to protect the\nemployee from the products handled; for example, in the produce industry, raw vegetables arriving from the fields may\nbe covered in mud or dirt, and employees wear overalls to protect their personal clothing and - it is used only in\nlow-risk or enclosed product areas (these are both defined in Appendix 2 of the Standard). It is important that where a\nsite wishes to approve home laundering, both of these requirements are satisfied. For example, home laundering would\nnot be permitted in bakeries because although the protective clothing is being used in a low-risk area, it is an open\nproduct area where the clothing is needed to protect the product, not the employee. Home laundering still requires\nappropriate care and attention to ensure that potential pathogens are removed or killed. Therefore, where approved,\nhome laundering needs to be controlled by written instructions, including, for example: - how garments are to be washed\n(temperature, detergent, specifying items not to be washed together, and drying instructions such as the use of a hot\niron to further heatdisinfect the clothes) - procedures for transporting clean protective clothing to the workplace;\nfor example, provision of sealable plastic bags or similar, which allow washed garments to be transported from home to\nthe workplace without becoming contaminated - on-site procedures; for example, defined responsibility within the\ncompany for monitoring the effectiveness of the system (typically achieved by visual inspection). There must also be a\nprocedure and system for effectively dealing with any case where employees are unable to perform self-laundry, either\nthrough lack of diligence or through lack of facilities. This system must be capable of being brought into immediate\neffect once a problem has been identified."

I 8 Production risk zones – high risk, high care and ambient high care\nWhere a site produces products where the production process, or part of it, requires high-risk, high-care and/or\nambient high-care production zones (see clause 4.3.1 for this assessment and Appendix 2 of the Standard for the\ndefinition of these production zones), all the relevant requirements from sections 1–7 of the Standard must be\nfulfilled in addition to the requirements in this section. The site shall be able to demonstrate that production\nfacilities and controls are suitable to prevent pathogen contamination of products. Interpretation Prevention of\npotential contamination with pathogens is of paramount importance in the production of safe food. One of the key ways\nof achieving this is to ensure the correct design (e.g. segregation) and control (e.g. restricted access) of areas of\nthe site where open products, susceptible to contamination, are handled. The Standard defines these areas as production\nrisk zones. The main principle of the production risk zones in the Standard is to ensure that the environmental\nconditions and controls in open product areas are appropriate for the products being handled. Therefore the\nexpectations for factory hygiene, finish of buildings, equipment, protective clothing and staff hygiene should reflect\nthe potential risks to the product. Where a site produces products that require handling in high-risk, high-care and/or\nambient high-care production facilities (see Appendix 2 of the Standard for the definition of products that require\nthese facilities), equivalent controls are expected for any subsequent handling or re-packing operation where the\nproduct is open to the factory environment (i.e. the re-packing site is expected to have equivalent facilities). BRCGS\nhas produced a specific guideline on high risk, high care and ambient high care, which explains the requirements and\nprovides details of good practice. It may be purchased from the BRCGS Store or viewed online at BRCGS Participate."

For example, this could be a\nmicrobiological kill step such as heat treatment or cooking, or a process to reduce the pathogen levels such as a\nchlorine wash of fruit or vegetables. The production risk zone needs to be maintained until the products are enclosed\nin packaging. For high-risk, high-care and ambient high-care areas, the location of the site’s pathogen control step(s)\nmust be included on the site map. As explained in the interpretation for clause 4.3.2, the site map must also include\nan indication of any areas where time segregation is used; for example, which areas apply time segregation between high\ncare and low risk. The boundaries of this segregation must be clearly detailed. The Standard is not prescriptive on the\nformat of the site plan; however, good practice is to include all the information in an easy-to-use form.

Practices shall be in place to minimise the risk of\nproduct contamination (e.g. the disinfection of materials on entry).",
    "interpretation_guidance": "High-risk areas High-risk areas require the highest levels of hygiene, working practices, and design and fabrication of\nfacilities and equipment, to prevent product contamination from microbiological hazards. High-risk areas must be fully\nseparated areas, with physical segregation in place between them and other parts of the facility. The purpose of the\nphysical segregation is to provide a self-contained area where uncovered (i.e. unprotected) high-risk products are\nhandled after the microbiological kill step (e.g. heat treatment or cooking) until they are fully protected, usually by\nmeans of final packaging. The segregating barrier must be capable of minimising the risk of cross-contamination from: -\npathogens which may be present in a low-risk environment or on products or ingredients that have not received a full\ncook - all people moving between the high-risk area and other areas, except through designated changing areas - the\nmovement of all equipment, cleaning chemicals, utensils or materials into the high-risk area, except through designated\nports with sanitising controls in place - water or other liquids (e.g. cleaning chemicals) on the floor, washing into\nthe high-risk area - airborne contaminants (e.g. dust particles or water droplets). Interpretation continued The ideal\nbarrier is a full wall (e.g. a separate room) separating the high-risk area from other areas. In assessing the\nsuitability of a segregating barrier, a risk assessment should be carried out and documented. Time segregation is not\nan acceptable alternative for high-risk areas, except for the transfer areas noted below. The location and operation of\nall transfer points must not compromise high-risk and low-risk segregation. For example, where raw materials or staff\nmove into a high-risk area, consideration must be given to whether this introduces a contamination hazard; it may\ntherefore require measures that involve: - use of disinfection - removal of outer packaging - double-door ovens, blast\nchillers or freezers (i.e. those with a separate entrance and exit) - controlled air flow (clause 8.2.2) - changing the\ndesign of entrances and exits (e.g. roller lifting doors may represent a risk when raised, due to the fact they have\nbeen in contact with the floor and the difficulty in cleaning them effectively). High-risk areas are expected to be\nself-contained and fully segregated. Best practice is that, where there is a cook step in the production of high-risk\nproducts, the cooker becomes the transfer point into the high-risk area via a double-door system (i.e. the cooker is\nloaded in the low-risk area and unloaded directly into the high-risk area). While new cooker installations and\nnew-build sites must incorporate double-door cooking systems, many existing plants are equipped with single-door\ncookers and have established risk-based procedures for the loading and unloading of the cookers to prevent\ncross-contamination of cooked products. The Standard will, therefore, accept the use of single-door cooking systems\nwhere a thorough risk assessment has been completed as an interim measure prior to the eventual upgrading. Operating\npractices must be consistently achievable and effective, and prevent cross-contamination of cooked products. The risk\nassessment must consider, and control potential risk, from: - crossover between cooked and raw products in the\nunloading area - operators and their clothing (e.g. handling of cooked products by operators who have previously worked\nwith raw products) - hand-contamination resulting from touching surfaces such as common equipment, cooker control\npanels and cooker door handles - equipment used for transferring product into and out of cookers - airborne\ncontamination from low-risk processes (e.g. the loading and unloading area should be separate from the main low-risk\nprocessing area) - the floor (e.g. contamination of the wheels of trolleys transferring cooked products to the\nhigh-risk area). When cooked products are unloaded from the cooker, they must be moved immediately to a designated\nhigh-risk area to meet the requirements of the Standard. The auditor will assess the procedures in operation where\nsingle-door cookers are in use to ensure they are adequate, effective and understood by operators. The audit report\nwill describe the procedures in place to protect the cooked products from contamination. High-risk areas contain only\ncomponents and foods which have undergone a cook or similar process to achieve, typically, a 6-log reduction for\nListeria. Where a single area includes, by necessity, some components which have received a lesser kill, together with\nfully cooked components (e.g. in a sandwich preparation area), this will be classed as high care. 270 brcgs.com Clause\nRequirements Example Cooked crustacea – a product requiring a high-risk production zone Where crustacea are cooked as\npart of the production process, or were cooked at an earlier step in the production process (including at another\nsite), the site will need to ensure the correct production risk zones are used. According to the definitions in\nAppendix 2 of the Standard, cooked crustacea fit into the definition of a product requiring a high-risk production zone\nbecause: - finished product is chilled or frozen to preserve food safety - all components have received a full cook\n(equivalent to a 6 log reduction in Listeria monocytogenes) - finished product is vulnerable to growth of pathogens or\nsurvival of pathogens that could subsequently grow during normal storage and use - finished product is ready to eat or\nready to heat or, on the basis of known consumer use, is likely to be eaten without adequate cooking. Although the\nStandard recognises that some food products can be effectively managed using consumer cooking instructions, these\ninstructions are not considered a valid justification for using a different production zone for cooked crustacea, as\nknown consumer use in many countries is to eat the product cold without any heating, and therefore without a full cook\nby the consumer. Furthermore, the product appearance could lead consumers to believe the product is already fully\ncooked, and that no additional cooking is required. Where a site is partially heating a crustacean (i.e. less than a\n6-log reduction in Listeria monocytogenes), a high-care area will be appropriate."

It is important that the high-care area is effectively protected from contamination by\nlow-risk zones. This is most effectively achieved through full physical segregation by means of walls which separate\nthe high-care area from other factory areas. Where a separate, fully walled-off area is not available, alternative\nprocedures must be in place to segregate the high-care area. The segregating barrier must be capable of preventing the\nrisk of cross-contamination from: Interpretation continued - unauthorised access and movement between high-care and\nother areas of the factory, except through designated changing areas - transfer of materials, cleaning chemicals,\nutensils or equipment, except through designated ports with sanitising controls in place - microbiological\ncontamination which may be present in a low-risk environment - airborne contaminants (e.g. dust particles or water\ndroplets). The segregating barrier may include time or space separation, control of movement or other restrictions. In\nassessing its suitability, a risk assessment must be carried out and documented. The method employed must be validated\nto demonstrate that the controls are effective in preventing cross-contamination. The auditor will critically examine\nthe arrangements to ensure that potential risks for contamination have been addressed, and that the alternative\ncontrols are consistently workable before the solution is considered acceptable. (This will be recorded in the audit\nreport.) Where the solution is time segregation (i.e. a time separation between low-risk and highcare products being\nproduced in the same area, to allow the area to be converted from a low-risk zone to a high-care zone (e.g. by\ncleaning, changes of protective clothing, or environmental monitoring)): - The changeover between low-risk and\nhigh-care operations should be as infrequent as possible, as it is unlikely that a sufficient standard of cleaning\ncould be reached if changes occur frequently during the day. - Fully validated procedures to change the area from low\nrisk to high care are required. These activities need to be taken into account when scheduling production, to ensure\neffective transformation of the area, including personnel. If the same personnel are responsible for the area during\nlow-risk and high-care operations, they must undergo a complete change of protective clothing. - The shared area must\nbe designed to meet the requirements of the high-care zone. Therefore all the facilities must be appropriate for a\nhigh-care production zone; for example, drainage is appropriate and meets the requirements of clause 8.2.1. Where\nproduct characteristics meet the description of high care but the systems are fully enclosed (e.g. dairies filling\ncartons with milk), the production area is considered an enclosed product area. However, additional precautions are\nrequired when breaking into the lines or entering filler equipment (e.g. for maintenance, to free product blockage or\nfor cleaning). Wherever equipment is entered, the necessary hygiene requirements must be completed before operations\ncan recommence. It is expected that newly built factories will employ full wall segregation where high-care facilities\nare required. 272 brcgs.com Clause Requirements"

When personnel leave the high-risk or high-care area, there must be clear\ninstructions for changing out of protective clothing to ensure that they remove their overalls before handling shoes or\na hair covering. (This is particularly important where the clothing is to be reused; for example, if someone is\ntemporarily leaving the area for lunch or a break.)

By exception, boot-wash facilities may be used instead of changing into\ncaptive footwear dedicated to the area; these must be located at the entrance to an area. Boot-wash facilities must be\neffectively controlled, managed and validated to prevent the introduction of pathogens. The site must have undertaken a\nrisk assessment to identify the suitability of the boot-wash facilities, and have established controls to manage the\neffective sanitation of footwear.

All visitors and contractors entering the\narea will need dedicated footwear; shoe covers are not satisfactory for high-risk or high-care areas, as they rarely\ncover the whole shoe and often tear or fragment during use, resulting in a lack of protection and the potential to\nbecome foreign-body risks. The objective of the use of dedicated clothing is to prevent the potential contamination of\nproducts. If members of the cleaning team (or indeed anyone else, such as engineers or visitors) enter an area while\nproduction is in progress or open products are present, they must follow the same clothing rules as production staff.\nIf cleaning occurs outside production time, the absolute rules on protective clothing may be adapted but must ensure\nthat the production area is left in a condition, after cleaning, such that no microbiological risks have been\nintroduced by the cleaners or the equipment used. The same principles apply to engineers undertaking maintenance work\n(which should be followed by cleaning to restore the microbiological security of the area). Wherever practical,\nauditors will be expected to observe the cleaning in high-risk areas to ensure that the practices used are effective\nand that controls are in place to prevent this activity introducing new risks.

Approval will be dependent on the product and the risks associated with it (the\noutput of clauses 9.2.1 and 9.1.1) and will include one or more of the following activities: - certification to the\nrelevant BRCGS Standard (such as food safety, packaging, storage and distribution, or agents and brokers) or a\nGFSI-benchmarked scheme. The site must confirm the validity of the certification. This will include: - confirmation of\nthe certification status (this could be confirmed on an independent database; for BRCGS Standards, it can be confirmed\nin the BRCGS Directory). Photocopies of certificates are not recommended and on their own are not considered suitable\nvalidation of certification status. During the BRCGS audit, the site may be asked to demonstrate its validation process\n- confirmation that the certification remains up to date (e.g. by receiving confirmation of successful completion of\nthe recertification process or by recording certificate expiry dates and completing checks for ongoing certification) -\nconfirmation that the products are within the scope of the certification. 288 brcgs.com Clause Requirements\nInterpretation continued - a successful site audit which at a minimum covers product safety, traceability, HACCP and\ngood manufacturing processes. This audit must be completed by an appropriately experienced and competent auditor (i.e.\nsomeone who has completed training in auditing techniques, has experience of auditing, and has knowledge of the\nproduct, ingredient or processes being audited). Non-conformities should be addressed (e.g. in an agreed action with\ntimescales) unless they are critical to product safety or legality, in which case supply should not be permitted until\nnon-conformities have been satisfactorily addressed. If the supplier is audited to a standard that is not\nGFSI-benchmarked, this may be acceptable providing that: - the scope of the audit meets the requirements of the\nStandard - the site has a copy of the full audit report (not just a certificate) - the site can demonstrate the\ncompetence of the auditor. Where the risk assessment (completed as part of this clause) indicates that a supplier is\nlow risk (because of the history of trading with the site, the nature of the products traded etc.), the completion of a\nsupplier questionnaire with a focus on food safety and quality may be sufficient. If a supplier questionnaire is the\nonly mechanism used to assess a supplier (i.e. there are no additional activities such as supplier audits), then it is\nimportant that the questionnaire (and the replies from the supplier) contains all the relevant information to allow the\nsite to confidently decide on approval. The auditor will expect to see, and will challenge, any risk assessments that\ndetermine that suppliers have been deemed to be low risk."

It characterises the\nrange of values that could reasonably be expected for the attribute being measured (e.g. the micro-organism, allergen\nor chemical). It is sometimes referred to as the margin of doubt for the result. Measurement uncertainty is important\nwhen making conformity decisions (i.e. assessing whether a test result is within legal, safe or acceptable limits) as\nthe uncertainty or range of probable values may cross the limit. A full explanation of measurement uncertainty is given\nin the Global Standard Food Safety Interpretation Guideline for clause 5.6.2. Mitigation strategies Controls to remove,\nor reduce to an acceptable level, an identified risk, vulnerability or threat. It is often used in food defence where\ncontrols are needed to prevent potential threats from occurring. Monitoring A planned sequence of observations or\nmeasurements of defined control parameters to assess whether predefined limits are being met. Non-conformity The\nnon-fulfilment of a specified product safety, legal or quality requirement or a specified system requirement.

Open product area An area in which product is open to the environment (i.e. not fully\nenclosed in packaging or within equipment/pipes). Outer packaging Packaging which is visible when the product is\nreleased from the site. For example, a cardboard box could be considered outer packaging even if wrapped in clear film.\nOutsourced processing (subcontracted processing) Outsourced processing (also referred to as subcontracted processing)\nis when intermediate production, processing, storage or a step in the manufacture of a product is completed at another\ncompany or site. Outsourced processing is an intermediate step; therefore during outsourced processing, the product or\npartly processed product leaves the site being audited for the completion of the outsourced processing before returning\nto the site. The audited site may or may not complete the additional packing or processing steps of the product. Where\nraw materials receive additional storage or processing prior to their arrival on site, this is not considered to be\noutsourced processing, but should be managed by the site using supplier approval mechanisms, raw material risk\nassessments and raw material specifications. When a product leaves the site and does not return, this is not outsourced\nprocessing; the activities completed off site are outside the scope of the audit. Ownership (change of company\nownership) A change of ownership occurs when the title is transferred from one individual or entity to another and\nresults in a change of control of the organisation.

Prerequisite The\nbasic environmental and operational conditions in a food business that are necessary for the production of safe food.\nThese control generic hazards covering good manufacturing and hygiene practices, and form a foundation for the food\nsafety or HACCP plan. Prerequisites shall be considered as part of that plan. Preventive action Action to eliminate the\nfundamental underlying cause (root cause) of a detected nonconformity and prevent recurrence. Primary packaging The\npackaging that constitutes the unit of sale to the consumer or customer (e.g. bottle, closure, label and tamper-evident\nseal of a retail pack or a raw material bulk container). When identifying primary packaging, due consideration must be\ngiven to the processes that minimise or eliminate any risk which may result in contamination of a food product; for\nexample: - using suitable food contact materials - consideration of anything that is applied onto the surface of a\npermeable food contact material (e.g. potential for migration of ink components through cardboard is a welldocumented\nrisk that has affected a range of packaging). As a general rule, the Standard would not expect transit materials to be\nclassified as primary packaging (e.g. pallets, pallet wrap, shrink wrap, pallet sheets, labels or cable ties applied on\nthe outside of the pallet wrap, recyclable and re-usable travel containers, and plastic crates used to hold glass\nbottles). Procedure Agreed method of carrying out an activity or process which is implemented and documented in the\nform of detailed instructions or process description (e.g. a flowchart).

Product recall Any measures aimed at achieving the removal\nof an unfit (e.g. unsafe) product from customers and final consumers. Product security For the purposes of the Global\nStandard Food Safety, product security refers to measures to prevent theft or malicious damage to products. Product\nwithdrawal Any measures aimed at achieving the removal of out-of-specification or unfit (e.g. unsafe) products from\ncustomers, but not from final consumers. A withdrawal is normally used to remove product where there is no risk to\nconsumers; for example, where the product has not reached the point of sale to consumers. Production risk zones Zones\nor areas within the processing and storage facilities that require specified levels of hygiene and segregation to\nreduce the potential for product contamination with pathogenic micro-organisms. The Standard recognises five production\nrisk zones: - high risk - high care - ambient high care - low risk - enclosed product areas. Sites will also have a\nrange of non-product areas which are separate from the processing and storage areas.
