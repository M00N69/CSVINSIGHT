    "interpretation_guidance": "Documented policy The site’s policy must clearly state the overall aims to meet customer requirements, including the\nprovision of safe, authentic products of the quality desired by the customer. The policy will also highlight the site’s\nintention to improve product safety and quality culture on a continuous basis, which, as discussed (for example, in the\ninterpretation for the statement of intent and importantly in clause 1.1.2), is fundamental in the consistent\napplication of product safety practices. The policy is designed to show the site’s intention, so that all staff can work\ntowards this common goal. Authenticity of products means ensuring that all products sold or purchased are of the nature,\nsubstance and quality expected. This applies not just to product claims, but includes all products and raw materials\nwith the assurance that they meet the specification. Authenticity is defined in the glossary. The policy must be signed\nby the person with overall responsibility for the audited site, to demonstrate the commitment at senior management at\nsite level. Where the policy is a group\n\n- or company\n\n- wide statement, the site management should endorse it; for example, by countersigning it. The policy statement is only a\nsummary and can usually be expressed in a single page. Although it does not need to be dated, it must be current and\nshould therefore be updated when significant policies or senior management change. The policy forms the foundation for\nthe site’s ways of working and the auditor will expect to see how the site management ensure staff understanding and\nengagement. This may include:\n\n- communication to staff (e.g. through display on noticeboards, inclusion in the induction process, availability on the\ncompany intranet, and the use of appropriate languages where the local language is not the first language of all\nemployees. The use of dual languages may improve and speed up understanding and action)\n\n- inclusion of all staff, including temporary and contract staff, in the communication and engagement processes."

    "interpretation_guidance": "Food safety and quality culture Analysis of the root causes of many non\n\n- conformities shows that a proactive, positive product safety and quality culture (hereafter referred to as culture)\nwithin a company can make all the difference in the effectiveness of the food safety and quality plan and its consistent\nimplementation throughout the site. Culture must be led by senior management and ‘felt’ throughout the organisation, so\nthat all aspects of the business are informed and involved. It is important to understand that the culture plan is\nunlikely to be successful if it is viewed as simply a technical function. It will require the input and commitment of\nthe site’s senior leadership team and may also align with several teams around the business; for example, with human\nresources (HR) or personnel management activities. Culture can be challenging. It relies not just on measurables and\nspecifics but an ethos and values felt by people at all levels of the site. The size and complexity (or simplicity) of\nthe site should not be a barrier to a successful culture. The site is required to develop, implement and maintain a\nclear plan or programme for developing and improving its culture. Such a plan should be based on the nature of the\norganisation, and dependent on its size, seasonality and the overall aims it has identified as important for its own\nculture. The clause does not prescribe the exact mechanisms that must be used; this is to allow the site flexibility to\ndevelop systems that are effective within its specific ways of working, and its current prevailing culture. It does,\nhowever, highlight the minimum scope of the plan. The plan will need to consider the measures needed to achieve the\nintended positive culture change.\n\nThe plan does not need to be annual. A strategic plan could, for example, cover 5 years, with activities designed to\nmeasure current culture, implement changes and assess improvements (or where improvement was not evident, a review of\nwhy). Some aspects of the plan may occur more frequently than others. However, for the plan to be effective, the\ndevelopment and improvement of culture will need to be treated as an ongoing and continuous process, and the auditor\nwill expect to see evidence that activities are being completed each year during which the plan is designed to operate.\nIt is not acceptable to design a 5\n\n- year plan where all of the activities are completed within the final year. Regardless of the intended length or lifetime\nof the plan, it is important that it remains relevant and up to date. The site will therefore need to ensure that it is\nregularly reviewed and updated. At a minimum there must be an annual review. A wide range of activities could be\nincorporated into a culture development plan, some of which the company may already be conducting. As a minimum the\nStandard requires:\n\n- a clear and open communication on product safety\n\n- training\n\n- feedback from employees\n\n- behaviour changes required to maintain and improve product safety processes\n\n- performance measurement on product safety, authenticity, legality and quality related activities. However, note that\nculture is not simply a matter of introducing another policy, but on developing attitudes and a positive approach to\nproduct safety and product safety processes. For example:\n\n- Ease of movement of product safety information between different levels and sections of the site can be an indication of\na good culture. However, a formal communication policy is not likely to affect company culture, unless the site has\nconsidered what is communicated, in what format. For example, if all communication is finance\n\n- related and lacks information on product safety, then staff may mistakenly believe that product safety is not important,\ndue to its lack of communication. Instead, regular, open and clear communication, involving all personnel, is needed,\nincluding expectations, benefits, product safety successes as well as deviations from what is expected or acceptable.\n\n- Training and staff development (e.g. the use of annual staff reviews and one\n\n- to\n\n- ones) should have a number of aims beyond just training the process or procedure (e.g. awareness of food safety issues,\nmanagement techniques, and development of positive behaviours and staff development).\n\n- Feedback from employees (e.g. staff surveys), focusing on values and culture, can provide useful information on current\nmindset and culture, impact of recent initiatives and preferred direction of travel. Feedback mechanisms also provide an\nopportunity to identify and address staff concerns.\n\nInterpretation\n\n- Consideration of the behaviour changes needed to improve culture – the site should choose relevant behaviours that will\nhave a positive impact on product safety. These relevant behaviours may be identified simply by a manager’s knowledge of\nthe site, or identified through the results of a site survey (such as the BRCGS Culture Excellence Module), or by\nconsidering the many indicators (or artefacts) of the behaviours, beliefs or attitudes that exist at a site. These can\nprovide an indication of the prevailing culture and could be used in this part of the plan. An artefact of culture is\ndescribed as an existing product safety activity that is not culture itself, but is indicative of the site’s prevailing\nculture (i.e. the site’s attitudes towards the value or importance of a specific product safety activity, and its\ncompliance with that activity, is often indicative of the culture of the site). These behaviours or attitudes are often\nidentifiable by the site and useful in the maintenance and improvement of product safety culture and can therefore be\nbuilt into the culture improvement plan. Many fundamental product safety processes could be considered artefacts of the\nculture; for example:\n\n- food safety policy\n\n- objective setting and management review\n\n- food safety in management meetings\n\n- food safety resources\n\n- risk awareness (e.g. for HACCP development)\n\n- effectiveness of corrective and preventive actions\n\n- internal audits\n\n- training. Remember that these activities are not the culture themselves; they are artefacts – indicators of the\nprevalent product safety behaviours at the site.\n\n- Performance measurement – this is different from clause 1.1.3. There, the objectives are used to directly improve food\nsafety, whereas the aim of this clause is to consider the impact of the results and learnings on product safety culture.\nFor example, if an objective is always met, or always missed, or the objective remains unchanged every year, this may\nindicate a site attitude towards the objectives and provides site leadership with an attitude to focus on. In other\nwords, is the site attitude to develop and continuously improve food safety using the objectives as one of the tools, or\nare the objectives set only to meet the requirements of the Standard? Along with the activities, the culture plan must\nalso include information indicating how activities will be undertaken, the intended timescales for completion, plans for\nmeasurement (including results from previous activities) and a review of the effectiveness of completed activities. This\ninformation should be used to review the plan to ensure it remains up to date and relevant for the site. It also has the\nbonus of creating a history of improvements and impacts. This information can be used, for example, to train new\nemployees, inspire existing staff and further inform the types of activity/implementation that are most effective at the\nsite and those which are more likely to struggle. Culture is often considered to be subjective and therefore difficult\nto audit. It must be emphasised that auditors are not expected to audit ‘food safety culture’ of the site, but the\nevidence of compliance with the requirements of the clause. The auditor will therefore examine evidence of conformity\nwith this requirement during both the audit of the facilities and the documentation audit. This will be achieved using a\nnumber of auditing techniques; for example:\n\n- a review of the documented plan and records – is it complete, does it contain all the relevant information, how were\nthe activities and objectives set, are the monitoring and review processes operating correctly and have they been used\nto review and update the plan to ensure it remains relevant for the site?\n\n- discussion with senior management on the development and implementation of the plan (refer to clause 1.1.11).\n\n- discussions may be conducted across all levels of personnel on an informal basis. The auditor would expect to find an\nawareness of food safety culture, how individuals can impact it, and the company’s objectives.\n\n- evidence of the site completing the activities in its action plan.\n\n- timescales and evidence that they have been met.\n\n- monitoring and review processes, and results from previous activities. BRCGS provides a number of services that can\nsupport a site’s development of its culture plan, including:\n\n- an additional voluntary module in product safety culture excellence which helps sites measure the current culture and\nidentify areas for improvement.\n\n- a guideline on product safety culture which may be purchased from the BRCGS Store or viewed online at BRCGS Participate.\n\n- a training course explaining culture and its implementation. Non\n\n- conformities To ensure expectations are understood relating to compliance with clause 1.1.2, its consistent application\nat certificated sites, and assessment during audits, BRCGS has trained auditors and certification bodies to apply the\nfollowing non\n\n- conformities, where sites are non\n\n- compliant:\n\n- Major non\n\n- conformity Where the site does not have a documented plan for food safety and quality culture. In this context a plan is\nmore than a short statement of intent, but is documentation incorporating all of the requirements of the clause.\n\n- Minor non\n\n- conformity Where a documented plan exists, but:\n\n- is of poor quality (e.g. lacks detail such as timescales for completion or clear action plans)\n\n- does not cover all the relevant areas or staff\n\n- is not fully implemented (e.g. some activities are not implemented or are not completed to a predefined schedule). The\nfinal bullet point in the clause requires sites to undertake a review of the effectiveness of completed activities.\nHowever, it is possible that this review of the success of the programme would not always be implemented in year 1\n(since a review cannot be completed until there are activities to review). Therefore non\n\n- compliance with this bullet point is not considered a non\n\n- conformity at the site’s initial audit, but will be assessed from the site’s second audit to the Standard onwards. The\nsite is expected to complete corrective action, root cause analysis and preventive action plans in accordance with\nsection 2.3 of the audit protocol prior to certification, and any non\n\n- conformity will be included in the calculation of the site’s grade.\n\nExample Food safety and quality culture plan The company decides to implement a culture plan. Based on the requirements\nof the Standard it identifies six key areas to include:\n\n- Enhanced training Beyond just managing critical control points (CCPs), to an understanding of the reasons for the\ncurrent product safety processes and involving staff in corrective actions.\n\n- Communications Regular staff updates in addition to the traditional internal message boards. Updates are used to\ncommunicate production, incidences of non\n\n- conforming product, customer complaints and their corrective actions, and improvements in product quality. They also\nfocus on company strategy and product safety objectives.\n\n- A clear feedback process To initiate communication ‘up’ to management, so that communication is not seen just as\nmanagement ‘telling staff’.\n\n- Recognition Management instigates ‘employee of the month’ awards as rewards for successful process improvement ideas.\n\n- Behaviours to maintain and improve product safety The site identifies two areas it would like to focus on:\n\n- Previously the site had developed reporting and whistleblowing systems which allow staff to feed back concerns relating\nto product safety, in accordance with clauses 1.1.6 and 1.2.3 of the Standard. However, staff feedback has identified a\nlack of use of the systems due to:\n\n- a lack of encouragement to report errors and product safety concerns\n\n- a lack of trust, and a feeling that it is not safe or comfortable to report problems\n\n- a belief that problems will not be taken seriously or that nothing will improve. Senior management therefore decides to\ninclude staff reporting and concerns about the current system in the culture improvement plan, and look for ways to\nbuild trust and encourage use.\n\n- Internal audits are an extremely useful site\n\n- based tool for monitoring and improving systems. However, the site notices that many departments undervalue the audit\nprogramme, with several reports reflecting a negative attitude towards the programme. Senior management also notes that\ninternal audits require effort and resource to complete robustly and effectively, which have not always been available.\nIn fact, at a previous management meeting the senior leadership had considered the potential to further minimise the\ninternal audit programme (e.g. by resorting to tick\n\n- box exercises, reducing the number of audits or auditors, and completing the minimum activity possible, rather than\nreviewing the actual risks). The culture plan therefore includes activities to build belief in, and use of, the internal\naudit programme, starting with education about the programme and its importance, training for new internal auditors,\ncommunication of audit results (positives as well as non\n\n- conformity), using the management review programme to consider learnings from the programme which can further benefit\nthe site.\n\n- KPIs The site’s quality KPIs have remained constant for a prolonged period. The site decides to use its annual customer\nreviews as an opportunity to review the quality KPIs to establish their continuing appropriateness.\n\nClause Requirements Example continued To ensure that the activities proceed according to the plan (and in accordance\nwith the Standard), the site management:\n\n- assigns timescales for the start of each activity\n\n- nominates leaders for each activity with responsibility to lead the activities identified\n\n- makes progress against the product safety culture plan an agenda item at the quarterly senior management team meetings\n\n- schedules a follow\n\n- up staff survey for 12 months’ time which will specifically be used to assess the effectiveness of the planned\nactivities\n\n- sets a review date for the complete plan."

    "interpretation_guidance": "Food safety and quality objectives Senior management must set objectives concerning food safety, authenticity, legality\nand quality that help to achieve the stated policy (see clause 1.1.1). The objectives must be communicated so that staff\nunderstand what is required from them. The setting of these objectives also helps the allocation of suitable budgets and\nresources. Auditors will look for evidence that the objectives are in place and have been communicated. Good objectives\nare usually:\n\n- Specific Objectives should be clear and directly related to the site’s aims or goals for product safety and quality.\n\n- Measurable Objectives should be measurable so that the site can assess progress.\n\n- Achievable Targets that stretch the company are acceptable but it is important that they are realistic and that\nsufficient resources will be available.\n\n- Relevant Objectives should be designed to maintain and improve product safety and quality.\n\n- Time\n\n- bound Objectives can be long\n\n- term (e.g. throughout the period of certification) or shorter\n\n- term (e.g. within the next 3 months); however, the timescales or deadlines should be clear to enable the site to review\nprogress and, if necessary, amend activities. There are many examples of objectives that could be included. For example:\n\n- reductions in customer complaints, non\n\n- conforming products and/or customer rejections or returns\n\n- reductions in audit failures or audit non\n\n- conformities – include both internal and external audits, but ensure that all audits are still completed to a thorough,\nrigorous quality\n\n- improved product safety training\n\n- improvements to the management of product authenticity\n\n- increases to product testing.\n\nInterpretation continued In each of these examples it would be necessary for the site to consider how to make the\nobjective specific and measurable (as discussed above); for example, 10% fewer customer complaints to be achieved by\nyear end. Objectives associated with product authenticity are likely to be formed differently; for example, they may be\nlinked to:\n\n- improvements to the traceability systems or traceability testing (section 3.9)\n\n- evolution of product monitoring processes such as product testing (section 5.6)\n\n- outcomes from the vulnerability assessment (section 5.4)\n\n- updates to the supplier approval mechanisms and the ongoing monitoring of suppliers (section 3.5). A similar situation\nexists for objectives associated with legality, as these will also need to be formed differently from those commonly\nused for product safety. For example, where there is proposed legislation in the region where the company operates, then\npossible targets may relate to ensuring that relevant staff are trained in a timely manner. Progress against targets\nmust be reviewed and reported to senior management at least quarterly. It may, for example, be included in management\nmeetings (e.g. those scheduled for clause 1.1.4), or it may be the subject of a separate review or included in a report\nto management. Auditors will look for documented evidence of communication and the quarterly progress review. The\nStandard also requires communication to staff (including all employees and agency\n\n- supplied staff). The Standard is not prescriptive on the methods of communication used to meet this clause. For example,\nany of the following could be used: meetings, briefings, cascades, huddles, electronic media (e.g. email), and company\nnoticeboards. Independent sites or facilities that are part of a large group with company\n\n- wide objectives can adopt the company\n\n- wide objectives, but are required to ‘own’ the objectives and carry out the implementation, monitoring, review etc. at\nsite level."

    "interpretation_guidance": "Senior management review The purpose of the management review meeting is to take an overview of the food safety systems.\nIt should therefore be a full and detailed examination of what has happened and what should happen in future. It is not\nthe ongoing management of an issue or concern (although the agenda may include a review of any such concerns) and it is\nnot just incident/ non\n\n- conforming product management (processes for these activities are covered in the relevant sections of the Standard; for\nexample, in sections 3.8 and 3.11). The format of the meeting should reflect company size. The Standard identifies\nspecific agenda items that must be included within the meeting; however, additional relevant subjects should also be\nincluded where appropriate. As a minimum the meeting agenda should therefore consider:\n\n- minutes of the previous management reviews and actions agreed. For example, the previous meeting may have set actions\nand timescales for their completion; however, if actions were not completed on schedule or have failed to be effective,\nfurther investigation and actions will be required\n\n- what has been achieved or not been achieved and progress against objectives (see clause 1.1.3); for example:\n\n- if an objective has been met the site can consider future targets based on achievements to date\n\n- if an objective has not been met the site can consider why. This can be very informative and allows future objectives\n(or other actions such as the product safety culture plan) to focus on areas where relevant, achievable actions can take\nplace. This review need not be exhaustive (such as a full root cause analysis) but the site should be able to understand\nwhy objectives were not met. The outcome would not be preventive action but continual improvement, allowing the site to\nrefine its future targets\n\n- internal, second\n\n- party and/or third\n\n- party audits, and subsequent actions. As a minimum the Standard requires a summary of the results from the internal\naudit programme to be reviewed at these meetings (see clause 3.4.3). This provides two opportunities for the senior\nmanagement team:\n\n- a review of non\n\n- conformities, corrective actions, root causes and preventive actions, with a focus on any outstanding concerns or\nadditional actions required (individual issues should have been identified and acted upon at the time they were\nidentified and where necessary, escalated to the management team during the year)\n\n- review of the overall performance and key trends should facilitate continuous improvement (e.g. changes to the frequency\nof auditing particular areas, training needs or suggestions for improvements or further developments of the internal\naudit programme) Similarly, second\n\n- or third\n\n- party activities (including customer audits, regulatory authority visits) could be summarised to facilitate further\ndiscussion and identify any actions or improvements that need to be made\n\n- progress against the product safety and quality culture plan and the effectiveness of completed actions\n\n- product safety incidents, complaints, out\n\n- of\n\n- specification results or non\n\n- conforming products, to ensure these have been fully actioned, to assess any trends and identify any additional follow\n\n- up actions or improvements needed as a result of these incidents and non\n\n- conforming situations\n\n- the management and effectiveness of product safety systems such as HACCP, food defence and product authenticity, along\nwith any existing or emerging issues relating to these topics\n\nInterpretation continued\n\n- identification of targets and areas of improvement for the coming year\n\n- changes to resource requirements. It is important that sufficient information is presented to the meeting to enable a\nfull and meaningful discussion and, where appropriate, actions to be agreed. Senior management is considered to consist\nof managers who have the authority to make decisions on food safety objectives and/or the provision of adequate human\nand financial resources. The management team would usually include the site manager and those managers responsible for\nproduction, technical operations, purchasing, engineering and human resources. For large, multi\n\n- site organisations the management review meeting may include head office representatives, but this decision should be\ndriven by the senior management on site. It may also include representatives from any departments responsible for\nspecific product safety activities or for specific agenda items. Good practice is to ensure that the meeting is put into\nall attendees’ diaries sufficiently early to maximise attendance and that agendas and papers are circulated in advance.\nThe auditor will be looking for evidence that, for each agenda item, sufficient information has been provided to allow\nan informed discussion to take place leading to appropriate action plans. This may be demonstrated through a review of\nthe inputs to the meeting, minutes of the discussion of the items and, where necessary, agreed action plans. To\ndemonstrate that, for example, senior management has reviewed the management of the HACCP system, the minutes should\ncontain a general summary of the HACCP review meeting (see section 2.12.3) and a record of its outcomes (these would be\ninputs into the management review meeting), together with any actions requested during the senior management meeting\n(i.e. outputs of management review meeting). One of the outputs from the meeting is a review of performance against the\nobjectives (clause 1.1.3) and the establishment of new or amended targets and objectives for the following year. This\nshould be clearly documented within the minutes of the meeting. The outcomes from the review meeting must be\ncommunicated to the relevant staff to ensure implementation. It should be evident to the auditor how this has been\nachieved (e.g. cascaded through staff briefings or posted on noticeboards). It should also be evident that actions are\nfollowed up and completed. For example, evidence of completion could be added to meeting records, or assessment of\nactions could be added to the internal audit programme. The Standard requires an annual review, such as a regular annual\nmanagement review meeting. However, it is important that meetings are scheduled correctly and of sufficient frequency to\nmaximise the value of the meeting and allow timely actions. Many companies opt to make a review or partial review more\nfrequently (e.g. every 6 months or each quarter), either addressing all the points in summary (after other review\nmeetings) or addressing one or two points in depth in each meeting. The number of meetings and the individual agendas\nshould be based on company need, providing all relevant topics are covered within the 12\n\n- month period. Where meetings are scheduled with a large intervening period (e.g. annually) the site needs a process to\nensure that any matters needing consideration can be completed in a timely fashion; for example, by incorporating them\ninto management meeting agendas (see clause 1.1.5).\n\nSpecial consideration should be given to seasonal and temporary sites to ensure meetings occur at an appropriate point\nin the season and that actions, targets or objectives can be completed. Some sites therefore opt for two meetings; for\nexample, one at the start of the season, to allow objective setting, and one at the end of the season, when the season’s\ninformation can be assessed. Alternatively, a management meeting shortly after an external audit allows any non\n\n- conformities to be included in the discussion and relevant corrective actions to be agreed. All sites should have a\npredefined schedule so all participants are aware, in advance, of when the meetings will take place."

This could include information obtained as\na result of activities to comply with clause 1.1.8\n\n- overview of KPIs, complaint levels or other relevant metrics. Meetings will need to include management of a seniority to\nmake decisions, and where appropriate, take actions. Most sites have weekly or monthly management meetings and the\ninclusion of safety, authenticity, legality and quality as an agenda item within this meeting is one way to meet the\nrequirements of this clause. A schedule for the meetings needs to be in place. Seasonal sites are not expected to have\nmonthly meetings when the site is closed and not operating, but scheduling should consider the length of the season and\nprocesses to ensure that food safety, authenticity, legality and quality issues can be discussed in a timely manner. For\nexample, the first meeting could take place shortly before the season begins, with further meetings monthly or even\nweekly throughout the season, and a final meeting at the end of the season. The audit will confirm whether:\n\n- the meetings occur at a defined frequency (e.g. a schedule, diary bookings or agendas)\n\n- previous meetings contained relevant discussions (e.g. agenda and minutes for the meetings which clearly state\nconclusions and any additional actions).\n\nInterpretation continued Good practice is to ensure that any decisions and actions agreed are communicated to\nappropriate staff, and that there is a system to check that actions are implemented within agreed timescales."

    "interpretation_guidance": "Confidential reporting system (whistleblowing) In 2018 a report from the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners found\nthat reports from employees and outside parties are by far the most common method of detecting wrongdoing. It is\ntherefore vital that all sites facilitate effective communication methods allowing staff to report any concerns.\nIdeally, this will be achievable using procedures developed to meet clause 1.2.3. However, from time to time it may be\nnecessary for individuals to report on hazards or infractions anonymously and confidentially (e.g. if a staff member\nfelt that a genuine concern raised through other mechanisms, such as those covered in clause 1.2.3, had not been\nadequately addressed), so the site (or company) should have a system in place to manage this. Although the aim of the\nStandard is to ensure these reporting systems relate to product safety, authenticity, quality and legality, the company\nmay choose to incorporate all staff concerns into the system, and not limit it to concerns related to the scope of the\nStandard. As a minimum, the system used must ensure that the confidentiality of the employee reporting the concern is\nmaintained (i.e. the employee’s identity is not known or released to the site or company management) to protect any\nstaff using it, and the confidential and anonymous nature of the system should be clear to all staff. An email or\ntelephone call to an on\n\n- site manager, for example, is unlikely to be anonymous or confidential as the manager is likely to know the employee’s\nemail address or recognise their voice. Therefore this would not be considered a confidential system. Many food\nprocessors will also have whistleblowing systems established by the brand owners and retailers for which it produces.\nWhere this is the case, the site is still required to have its own system as affected products may not relate to the\nspecific brand owner. Additionally, in some areas, local relevant regulatory authorities will have facilities for\nconfidential reports about a site but this also does not mitigate the need for a site (or company) to have a system. As\nwell as gathering information, the site is required to collate and act on it. The auditor will expect to see a system in\nplace, and transparency about the content of any reports and actions, although not the source of the original concern.\nWhere possible, sites might consider an independent system that receives and processes any concerns raised with\nappropriate promptness. For example, where quality, safety or conformity of the product is at risk, action should be\nimmediate. This might be by using an independent consultant or a professional organisation that can act as an\nintermediary.\n\nWhere local legal requirements prohibit certain activities around confidentiality or such reports, the site will need to\nensure the system employed meets these legal requirements. This will also be acknowledged by the auditor and compliance\nwith this clause noted within the context of the legal framework. It is not uncommon for larger companies to base the\nmanagement of their confidential reporting systems at head office, rather than at each individual site. This is\nacceptable and the audit process is explained in Appendix 4 of the Standard. BRCGS operates the independent ‘Tell BRCGS’\nfacility (available online). This has been designed so that BRCGS can receive information from any interested party\nabout the status of certificated sites or the certification process. Therefore, when feedback is received, it will be\ninvestigated and this may, for example, identify the need for a compliance audit at the implicated site to ensure that\nit is operating legally and in compliance with the Standard. This is different from the aim of this whistleblowing\nclause, which is to provide the site/ company management with an opportunity to receive and address any concerns raised\nby employees without the site being subject to an external review. Therefore, a site using the Tell BRCGS system without\nits own confidential reporting system will not achieve the intended aim of the clause, although it could be used for\nsituations where an employee has tried other site\n\n- specific options and is still sufficiently concerned to raise the matter with BRCGS."

Therefore, non\n\n- conformities identified in the previous certification audit must have been fully and effectively rectified (i.e.\ncorrective and preventive actions completed) and these will be checked during the current audit. Therefore, for each non\n\n- conformity at the last audit, the auditor will expect to see:\n\n- Corrective action The site will have completed its corrective action within 28 days of the last audit. The auditor will\ntherefore expect to see this action in operation (e.g. that the updated procedure submitted to the certification body as\nevidence of corrective action is in use, or that repairs have been completed and remain effective).\n\n- Preventive action At the time when the certificate was awarded, the site will have submitted a preventive action plan,\nbut may not have completed all of the preventive action. The auditor will therefore expect to see evidence that the site\nimplemented preventive action and that recurrence of the non\n\n- conformity has therefore been effectively prevented.\n\n- Root cause analysis Root cause analysis is used to identify the fundamental or root cause of a non\n\n- conformity, and is therefore a key activity in establishing appropriate preventive action. Although the site submitted\nthe root cause analysis following the previous audit, the auditor may need to review this; for example, if preventive\naction has been ineffective at preventing the non\n\n- conformity. This process is detailed in II of the Standard, section 2.3.2. Many sites have found it useful to retain\ncopies of records and documents implicated by non\n\n- conformities with the audit records. This allows quick and easy reference to the specific document while reviewing,\ninvestigating and correcting the non\n\n- conformity. (The original copy of the document, should, of course, be returned to the appropriate place in the site’s\nquality system.) Note that additional information on preventive action and root cause analysis, and non\n\n- conforming situations which require their use, is detailed in I, section 3.7 of the Standard, and especially clause\n3.7.2. A site’s attitude towards preventive action may also indicate its product safety culture. For example, minimal\nfollow\n\n- up, or preventive action that is just seen as a necessary document to pass an audit, may be a sign of a poor culture.\nBRCGS has published a guideline to understanding preventive action and root cause analysis which explains some of the\ntechniques available for identifying the cause of non\n\n- conformities and preventing them from recurring. The guideline is available from the BRCGS Store or viewed online at\nBRCGS Participate. If effective corrective or preventive action has not been introduced (e.g. it has been ineffective at\npreventing recurrence), a non\n\n- conformity may be raised against this clause, in addition to a non\n\n- conformity against the clause that has the recurring issue."

For example, the\nrequirements of clause 1.2.1, regarding deputies and documented procedures, apply even where a food safety consultant is\nused. A food safety consultant is seen as a service provider to the site and is therefore subject to the requirements of\nsection 3.5.3. 38 The food safety plan – HACCP Fundamental The company shall have a fully implemented and effective food\nsafety plan incorporating the Codex Alimentarius HACCP principles. Interpretation The purpose of these requirements is\nto create a food safety plan to mitigate food safety hazards. The foundation of this food safety plan is a hazard and\nrisk analysis. In order to be effective this analysis must be systematic, science\n\n- based, thorough, fully implemented and kept up to date. In the food industry, the principles for assessing hazard and\nrisk are commonly referred to as HACCP. However, the specific terminology used in the Standard, such as prerequisites\nand critical control points (CCPs), are drawn from global terminology used to describe expectations. Sites are not\nrequired to use the specific terminology used in the Standard; alternative terminology is acceptable, providing it is\nevident that all the requirements have been fully met. For example, legislative requirements in the US (detailed in the\nFood Safety Modernization Act) use different terminology but still incorporate all the requirements of the Standard.\nSites are advised to avoid having multiple plans with different terminology as this is administratively complex and\nunnecessary. (It may, of course, be appropriate to have multiple plans where a site produces different types of products\nwith different product safety hazards, but common terminology should be used throughout.) Regardless of the terminology\nused the food safety plan must incorporate all of the Codex Alimentarius HACCP principles. The clauses in Issue 9 have\nbeen updated to reflect the latest publication of the Codex Alimentarius HACCP principles, therefore where it is evident\nthat all the requirements in section 2 have been fully met, a site will not be expected to undertake additional\nactivities to meet the Codex Alimentarius principles. The plan must be specific to the products manufactured, processed\nor packed on site and the production processes used. Codex Alimentarius has published background information and\nextensive guidance on the HACCP principles which can be found in the General Principles of Food Hygiene (CXC1\n\n- 1969) last updated in 2020. It can be downloaded from the Codex Alimentarius page on the FAO’s website. BRCGS offers\ntraining on HACCP implementation. Details are available from the BRCGS website."

The number of HACCP food safety team members needs to be appropriate to the size and structure of\nthe company, as the team will include representatives of each department with responsibility for the operation of the\nStandard (e.g. technical, quality assurance, purchasing, engineering, new product development, hygiene/sanitation and\nsenior leadership team). There will always be more than one person, since a single person does not constitute a ‘team’.\nThe team needs knowledge of the types of operations that are carried out at the site and the hazards these operations\nmay present to the product. It is good practice to document the team members within the study, with a summary of their\nroles, experience and areas of responsibility within the company. Membership of the HACCP food safety team needs to be\nreviewed and, when necessary, updated (e.g. when job responsibilities change or personnel leave or join the company).\nThe team leader must be able to demonstrate competency and experience in HACCP/food safety processes. This can be shown\nby:\n\n- the quality of the plan\n\n- documented evidence of their qualification (e.g. successful completion of an industry\n\n- recognised HACCP training course)\n\n- demonstrable, extensive experience in implementing or training HACCP. The team will need sufficient knowledge of HACCP\nprocesses, products manufactured on site, production processes and relevant hazards, to facilitate a thorough hazard and\nrisk analysis and the creation of an appropriate food safety plan. This may be demonstrated by, for example, training\nrecords (see clause 7.1.6) that show adequate training (e.g. through an industry\n\n- recognised training course or good quality internal training) has been given to all HACCP food safety team members. Any\nformat or delivery method of training is permitted; however, the outcome should be a suitably trained individual capable\nof executing a HACCP or food safety plan as part of their team. Where there is a legal requirement for specific training\nthe site is expected to ensure this has been completed. Where external expertise has been used in developing the HACCP\nor food safety plan, the site must demonstrate ownership of the identified requirements by ensuring that the day\n\n- to\n\n- day management of the food safety system remains the responsibility of the site (see clause 1.2.4). At the audit, the\ncompetency and understanding of the HACCP/food safety plan team will be assessed, as well as the quality of the\nresultant HACCP or food safety plan. The site should also be able to establish the training and competence of any\nexternal consultant in HACCP/food safety principles (see section 3.5.3). Senior management commitment (clauses 1.1.1 to\n1.1.14) is required to support the HACCP food safety team. This may be demonstrated by the presence of senior management\nwithin the team, policy statements referring to HACCP or food safety, or evidence within management review meetings that\nHACCP/food safety issues are discussed and reviewed.\n\nThe existence of a food safety plan does not, in itself, guarantee product safety, and it is vital that the results of\nthe HACCP or food safety plan are implemented, applied correctly and integrated into the food safety and quality\nmanagement system."

    "interpretation_guidance": "Prerequisites The prerequisites are the basic environmental and production conditions necessary for the manufacture of\nsafe food and the control of generic hazards. Note that the list of examples in the Standard is not exhaustive, and\nothers will exist in some sites; for example, utilities, air and general aspects of the production environment. Sites\nmust therefore define the full range of prerequisites applicable to their site and operations. Although the\nprerequisites are usually covered by day\n\n- to\n\n- day activities such as good manufacturing or hygiene practices, it is vital that they work effectively and to the\ncorrect standards as:\n\n- The prerequisite programme needs to provide a solid base on which the rest of the HACCP or food safety plan can be\ndeveloped.\n\n- The company is relying on the prerequisite activities to mitigate the identified hazards and deliver safe product (e.g.\nif a site identifies cleaning as a prerequisite, then it relies on the cleaning activities to adequately remove food\nresidues and dirt that might otherwise result in hazards such as allergen cross\n\n- contamination or microbiological contamination). Therefore there should be a whole work stream behind each identified\nprerequisite to ensure that the relevant activity, procedures and policies are in place, that they are working correctly\nand that they continue to deliver the level of control required. Although the prerequisite programme is expected to be\neffective in achieving the level of control required to ensure food safety, it is not a requirement that a documented\nvalidation of every prerequisite is undertaken, as prerequisite programmes typically cover a wide range of general\nenvironmental controls, often with results that are not quantifiable. However, where a prerequisite programme is used to\nmanage a specific hazard (e.g. cleaning regimes used to prevent allergen cross\n\n- contamination), there needs to be a documented validation that the prerequisite controls the identified hazard (see\nclause 2.7.4 for further details regarding the validation). Some companies prefer to differentiate prerequisites that\nmanage specific hazards from other prerequisites by referring to them as operational prerequisites (oPRPs). Sites that\nneed to meet the requirements of the US Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) should note that they must ensure that\npreventive controls are subject to validation and verification. Some of these controls may cover activities that have\ntraditionally formed part of the prerequisite programme. The clause contains references to later sections of the\nStandard which provide detail on the requirements for effective management of some specific prerequisites, including\ncleaning (section 4.11), pest management (section 4.14) and training (section 7.1). These are not intended to be an\nexhaustive list of all prerequisites or all the relevant sections of the Standard. The prerequisite programmes are often\ndependent on the production risk zoning (see clause 4.3.1); for example, cleaning within a high\n\n- risk zone. Therefore it may be necessary to place greater attention on some prerequisites that are particularly\nimportant for food safety in those specific zones. Good practice is to review the prerequisite programmes and their\nmanagement. The frequency of this review should be based on risk, but it could be included, for example, in the annual\nreview of the HACCP or food safety plan. 42 .3 Describe the product (equivalent to Codex Alimentarius Step 2) Clause\nRequirements"

During the BRCGS audit, the auditor will confirm the accuracy of the documented process\nflow diagram by following the process in production. It is vital that the process flow diagram remains up to date;\ntherefore verification should occur whenever there is a review of the HACCP or food safety plan (e.g. whenever there is\na change to the plan or operational activity) and at least once per year. For example, the manufacture of a new product\n(see clause 5.1.2) should result in a HACCP review to confirm that any hazards to existing products have been managed\nappropriately, as well as ensuring that any hazards affecting the new product are controlled. It is important that any\ndaily (e.g. different shifts, including any night or weekend shifts) or seasonal variations are considered during the\nverification process (e.g. the production of a Christmas range that uses ingredients or processes not used during the\nrest of the year or significant changes in production volume). The site must retain records of the diagrams and\nverification activities. For example, a verification record could include an annotated diagram showing:\n\n- the date and time of the verification\n\n- the product(s) being manufactured at the time the activity was observed\n\n- any amendments or alterations that were noted.

The Standard provides examples of\nthose that should be considered, including:\n\n- specific micro\n\n- organisms (e.g. E. coli or Salmonella)\n\n- specific chemicals (e.g. veterinary residues, pesticides or radiological contaminants)\n\n- cleaning chemicals\n\n- machinery lubricants\n\n- specific foreign bodies (e.g. glass, metal or plastic)\n\n- specific allergens (e.g. peanuts or egg); i.e. those identified by the company, materials that are considered allergens\nin the country of intended sale and any customer requirements\n\n- the potential for fraud and/or adulteration\n\n- malicious tampering with the product or processes. It is important that the company considers all relevant potential\nhazards from all relevant sources. These could include raw materials, processes and the factory environment. The process\nflow diagram is a useful tool in considering the potential risks at each stage of production. Some sites find it useful\nto consider each hazard, at each step, in terms of:\n\n- whether the hazard is likely to be present in, for example, the raw material or the processing environment\n\n- whether there is the potential to introduce or create a specific hazard at the step in the process being considered\n\n- if there is the potential for growth of micro\n\n- organisms\n\n- whether the hazard will survive the processing step; for example, whether a pathogen can survive in the product, or\nwhether the contaminant is stable to the process being completed (e.g. heat stable). There must be a description of each\nhazard and its sources – one hazard may have several potential sources and occur at more than one point in the process.\nThis is important to ensure that effective controls for each source of hazard are established in the subsequent steps of\nthe process. The Standard has referenced food fraud and malicious contamination (food defence) in the list of hazards in\nthis clause to draw attention to the need to include these within site assessments. However, later sections of the\nStandard (sections 4.2 and 5.4) provide greater detail on the expected activity in these areas. This clause does not\nrequire those assessments to be repeated or duplicated (as part of the HACCP plan, and then in compliance with sections\n4.2 and 5.4) – separate assessment processes are acceptable and the site can reference the additional assessment within\nthe HACCP plan. However, the outputs from those separate assessments must be considered as part of this process, to\nensure that the correct controls, monitoring, verification, etc. are in place. The aim of including radiological hazards\nwithin the clause is to consider potential contamination by radioactive isotopes (a legal requirement in some countries)\nwhich may be present in water or soil (either from a naturally occurring source or resulting from contamination caused\nby humans). A number of authorities produce reports on known radiological hazards; for example:\n\nIn the UK:\n\n- FSA: Radioactivity in Food and the Environment (RIFE)\n\n- UK Health Security Agency: Three Steps to Manage Radon in Buildings – Check, Measure, Act\n\n- UK government: Radioactivity in Food and the Environment (RIFE) Reports.

Records must be available showing how this has\nbeen conducted and how decisions have been reached. The Standard is not prescriptive on the tools used to facilitate\nthis process; for example, a two\n\n- or four\n\n- question decision tree may be useful.

Sites working in accordance with the US Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) are likely to find that the\npreventive controls required by that legislation include all of the controls that would normally be identified as CCPs\nusing a HACCP system. For example, CCPs are known\n\nInterpretation continued as process preventive controls (PPCs) in an FSMA\n\n- compliant food safety plan. For certification purposes, it does not matter which terms are referenced as their\nmanagement (for certification purposes) would be the same. Other preventive controls are historically treated as PRPs\n(prerequisite programmes) in many sites. In some cases, parts of them are elevated to preventive controls; these include\nfood allergen, sanitation, supply chain, based on known or reasonably foreseeable risk of a serious adverse health\nconsequence or death to humans or animals (SAHCODHA) hazard. Where the management components of those preventive\ncontrols do not contain all the same elements of the CCPs/PPCs it is expected that the site would combine the most\nstringent requirements of FSMA and the Standard together. For example, a sanitation preventive control does not require\nvalidation for allergen cleaning under FSMA but it is required by the Standard (see clause 2.7.4), therefore the\nStandard expects additional compliance with this requirement.

    "interpretation_guidance": "Documented management system The control of all documents within the food safety and quality system (for both external\nand internal use) is important for several reasons, including:\n\n- the documents are kept up to date\n\n- staff are working with the correct version\n\n- the potential for mistakes caused by multiple versions of a document is minimised. Therefore all documents in use need\nto be properly authorised and must be the correct version. The Standard requires the site to have a documented procedure\nthat describes the method by which documents are controlled and managed. This procedure needs to include instructions on\nhow the following features of the document management system are controlled:\n\n- responsibilities for the management of the system\n\n- list of all controlled documents, indicating the current version number and the allocation of controlled copies of the\ndocument (see below)\n\n- identification of controlled documents (e.g. document ID, issue date, version number)\n\n- records of the reason for any change(s) (see below)\n\n- method of rescinding and replacing documents. In order to demonstrate the control of document issue, it is necessary to\nmaintain a register of all controlled documents, their allocation and issue status. Where the controlled documents are\nall contained on an electronic system, it is usual for printed versions to be marked as uncontrolled. Each copy must be\nauthorised (e.g. with a signature or stamp) to show it is for use, and each must be given a version number so that out\n\n- of\n\n- date documents can be identified and removed. This must be evidenced by the fact that all documents in use are the most\nup\n\n- to\n\n- date versions. Where documents are maintained electronically, the site is required to ensure that they are stored\nsecurely and cannot be amended by unauthorised persons; for example, by using individual passwords or security swipe\ncards. This includes backing them up appropriately to ensure no data is lost. The auditor will ask to see evidence (e.g.\na procedure) that the site has an effective backup process, rather than auditing that the backup contains all the\nrelevant files.\n\nInterpretation continued The methodology or type of electronic storage is not specified. The site may choose to use an\ninternal server to store data; or it may use cloud services, which are generally considered to be secure and backed up,\nproviding there is control of authorised/authenticated users. When a document is changed, a record needs to be made of\nthe change and the reason for it. This can be achieved by keeping a copy of the previous version with the reason for the\nchange written on it, or by keeping a history of amendments. Consideration should also be given to the most effective\nmethod of communicating the changes to staff; for example, by highlighting the change within the new document or\ntraining relevant staff. Further guidance How to put a document control procedure in place Firstly, ensure there is a\nsingle, clear, documented system that operates across all documents within the food safety and quality management system\nand that it includes the minimum requirements highlighted in the Standard:\n\n- identification of the individual(s) responsible for management of the system (i.e. who is authorised to issue or amend\ndocuments). This might be someone with the authority to instigate and maintain the system\n\n- the list of all controlled documents\n\n- methods of identification of controlled documents\n\n- records regarding the reasons for any changes\n\n- the method of collecting and replacing documents. List of documents Your site needs a list of all the documents within\nthe food safety and quality system. Typically this will include:\n\n- the document identification or number. The Standard does not set out how you should identify your documents, but an\nexample format would be using sequentially numbered documents or an initial letter (often representing a department or\nactivity) followed by a number (e.g. P0123); Figure 6 shows an example\n\n- the document title. Use a concise title that clearly explains the purpose or content of the document (e.g. ‘metal\ndetector check procedure’)\n\n- the current issue or version number. Each time the document is updated, amended or replaced, a new version number should\nbe used\n\n- the issue date. Include the date when the current version of the document first came into force\n\n- withdrawal date (if applicable)\n\n- review date (if applicable). Documents may require periodic review to ensure the information remains applicable and up\nto date\n\n- the allocation of controlled copies (i.e. who has a copy of the document).\n\nClause Requirements Further guidance continued REFERENCE NUMBER TITLE VERSION NUMBER ISSUE DATE WITHDRAWAL REVIEW DATE\nALLOCATED COPIES P101 Metal Detection Check Procedure 1"

They must be created in such a manner that they accurately transmit the intended\ninformation (e.g. they can be read by others and are traceable to the creator of the record via initials or signature).\nWhere records are stored electronically, this storage must be secure.

Examples of appropriate periods for products or ingredients are as\nfollows:\n\n- Final products A period not less than the indicated shelf life plus 1 year.\n\n- Ingredients (i.e. where the site sells an ingredient that will be used in the manufacture of a final product) The shelf\nlife of the final product plus 1 year. Where the final\n\n- product shelf life is not reasonably known, records should be kept for 3 years or a period agreed with customers.\n\n- Products of an undefined shelf life (e.g. some wines and alcoholic drinks) The company should define a reasonable record\nretention period based on experience of customer usage, time for complaints and any legal precedents. It would be usual\nfor records to be kept for at least 3 years in these situations. Additional retention time may be required by\nlegislation, by customers or because of the nature of the product (e.g. extension beyond the normal shelf life by the\ninclusion of customer freezing instructions on the product packaging must be observed).

    "interpretation_guidance": "Internal audit programme The scope of internal audits needs to be established and must ensure that all aspects of the\nfood safety and quality management systems (including the HACCP programme, prerequisite programmes, policies,\ndocumentation, hygiene and production), the product safety and quality culture plan, and systems associated with\nauthenticity, product legality and quality management are audited at least annually. All the internal audits should not\nbe conducted on a single day; nor should every internal audit attempt to cover all aspects of the food safety and\nquality management system or the Standard. A once\n\n- a\n\n- year check against all the requirements of the Standard may be of value as a gap analysis when preparing for an audit or\nconfirming the contents of the food safety and quality management systems, but is insufficient to cover the full\nrequirements of an internal audit programme as it will not provide the depth of assessment or level of confidence\nrequired. Development of the internal audit schedule should begin with a risk assessment. The aim of this is to\nidentify:\n\n- all the areas or activities that need to be audited\n\n- the frequency with which each part of the product safety and quality management system needs to be audited. This will be\ndependent on the risk inherent in each activity or section of the food safety and quality management system. For\nexample, the site should be aware of the consequences of not complying with its own systems, which could lead to hazards\nnot being identified in a timely manner. Therefore internal audits of CCPs are likely to be more frequent than those for\nless critical activities. Frequency may also be influenced by known issues within the company or customer requirements.\nThis may result in a site needing to audit an activity multiple times throughout the year, or developing a programme\nwith more than four internal audit dates (see below)\n\n- the most relevant dates for each internal audit; for example, if activities or processes are seasonal (see below) or\nif specific activities need to be completed more than once a year. Sites may also find it useful to consider completing\ninternal audits during different shifts, including, for example, nights or weekends. The majority of sites are likely to\nbenefit from a programme of audit dates spread diversely throughout the year, as this maximises the opportunity to\nidentify any non\n\n- conforming processes in a timely manner, allowing correction and minimising the potential for standards to fall between\naudits. The Standard promotes this concept by requiring a minimum of four audit dates spread throughout the year.\nHowever, it does not require all audits to be completed quarterly, as there may be genuine situations where risk\nassessment shows an alternative frequency. Seasonality is an example; if a site is open only for part of the year, then\nthere is little value in completing internal audits while the site is shut. For seasonal production, the site is not\nexpected to complete a series of internal audits when the site is not operating; however, there must be a system for the\nmanagement of start\n\n- up processes, and internal audits are therefore expected to start before the season commences to ensure the site is\nready to start production. For example, the HACCP programme should be audited to ensure that it is up to date and\nappropriate for the forthcoming production; that hygiene and fabrication are correct; and that staff are appropriately\ntrained. The remaining areas of the internal audit programme should be covered throughout the season. Further\ninformation is available in the BRCGS Fresh Produce Guideline available from BRCGS Participate or the BRCGS Store. Even\nwhere a site is open throughout the year, seasonality can affect the internal audit dates; for example, if certain\nactivities, such as the harvest of grapes or bottling of wine, are only completed at certain times, or if there are\nseasonal changes in production volumes which apply a greater burden on the product safety systems at certain times of\nyear. Where a site is part of a multi\n\n- site company, and the company conducts annual corporate food safety audits, it is acceptable for this annual audit to be\nincorporated into the internal audit schedule. However, additional internal audits that look at specific parts of the\nfood safety and quality system, and compliance with the Standard, should be scheduled throughout the rest of the year.\nThe most common way of completing an internal audit is by taking documented procedures and work instructions and\ncomparing them with the actual working practices and records. Note that a tick\n\n- box exercise is not sufficient, as it does not provide the rigour or depth that an effective internal audit programme\nrequires. The use of an external consultant (e.g. by small sites) is acceptable, providing the internal audit programme\nis scheduled throughout the year and not in a single block of activity. See clause 1.2.4 and section 3.5.3 for details\nrelating to the requirements for product safety consultants. BRCGS has produced a guideline to internal auditing which\nis available on BRCGS Participate or from the BRCGS Store."

Internal auditors must be able to show via training records (clause 7.1.6) that\nthey have received formal training on internal auditing, via either attendance at an external course or training within\nthe company. Training should also cover the planning and scheduling of the internal audits, preparing audit reports in\nthe company’s agreed format, the correct use of audit techniques (e.g. documentation and process auditing, audit trails\nand discussions with colleagues) and follow\n\n- up of audit findings (see clause 3.4.3). Training must be of sufficient duration and depth to ensure that auditors can\ncomplete robust, consistent audits. External auditors may be used where internal resources are insufficient, providing\nthe requirements of clause 3.4.1 can be met (for scheduling audits throughout the year). The site should refer to clause\n1.2.4 and section 3.5.3 for the requirements for the management of food safety consultants. Internal auditors must be\nindependent of the process being audited. This is to ensure that there is no conflict of interest (i.e. that the audit\nis rigorous and thorough) and that any work needed to make corrections or improvements can be identified by an auditor\nwho is not biased or influenced by working in the area. Internal auditors may not audit their own work or any programmes\nfor which they are immediately responsible.

For example:\n\n- internal audit completed\n\n- corrective actions agreed\n\n- corrective actions completed and signed off\n\n- completion verified\n\n- root cause analysis used to identify any necessary preventive actions\n\n- preventive actions completed and reviewed\n\n- overall management review completed. Each internal audit must examine the process or activity in detail and will usually\ninclude a number of activities such as:\n\n- observing how activities are completed\n\n- asking relevant staff how an activity is completed or why it is completed in a specific way\n\n- reviewing procedures and records to confirm whether the activity has been completed and recorded correctly. In addition\nto the actual internal audit, it is important that appropriate reports are completed, clearly indicating what was\naudited, the actions that are agreed and the review of these actions. Reports must show evidence of conformity as well\nas non\n\n- conformity, with objective supporting evidence (e.g. what documents or actions were observed). Some sites have also\nfound it useful to include recommendations for improvement, where the audit can highlight any that are noted during the\naudit. Tick lists showing that items have been assessed will not normally be accepted as the only form of evidence;\ninformation showing how the audited items have fulfilled the requirements, or how they are non\n\n- compliant, is required. This is important, as recording conformity is documenting evidence that due diligence is taking\nplace; in other words, that required procedures are taking place, and have been observed by auditors who are independent\nof the process. This may subsequently be useful, for example, in the event of an incident, or for answering questions\nfrom regulatory authorities or customers.\n\nInterpretation continued Notes, references or copies of the documents and records should be kept as evidence of aspects\nthat have been examined, to allow an independent reviewer to reach the same conclusion as the internal auditor. For\nexample, the dates and titles of records that were inspected should be noted in sufficient detail to allow them to be\ntraced; if any records are non\n\n- compliant, precise details of the non\n\n- compliance should be given. The listing of records reviewed also ensures that a wide range of records are considered\n(e.g. training records of a variety of staff rather than repeated audits of the same records). Records will also confirm\nwhether anything has changed since the last audit. The Standard is not prescriptive regarding the format of the internal\naudit reports; for example, they may be hand\n\n- written, stand\n\n- alone electronic documents or uploaded into a company database. Good practice is to retain any auditor notes that are\ncompleted during the audit, as well as the final report. Figure 9 shows a typical example of a completed audit report.\nThe results of audits need to be communicated to the relevant staff; i.e. those who are responsible for the area or\nactivity, and corrective actions, root cause and preventive actions and timescales for their completion agreed. This may\nbe achieved via operational or review meetings, or via an update at the end of the audit combined with documentation\nsuch as a memo or a copy of the audit report. Responsibility for corrective actions must be documented – for example, by\nbeing recorded on the audit record sheet. Full details for handling non\n\n- conformities, including corrective and preventive actions, are provided in section 3.7. Note that finding a non\n\n- conformity during an internal audit should not necessarily be viewed as a negative, since it allows the site to\nimplement action before the non\n\n- conformity becomes a more serious problem. Where non\n\n- conformities have been identified, effective completion of corrective and preventive action must be verified. Good\npractice is to ensure that a nominated member of staff with the appropriate authority checks that the action has been\ntaken within the agreed timescale, and that this has rectified the problem sufficiently to prevent recurrence. The\nnominated staff member should not be the person responsible for completion of the actions; ideally this should be the\noriginal auditor. Good practice is to complete a review of the internal audit programme; for example, looking at the\noutputs and trends, and any insight these provide. A summary of the programme and results will also be required for the\nmanagement review meeting (see clause 1.1.4). A non\n\n- conformity will be raised against clause 3.4.3 if there is a non\n\n- conformity in the operation of the internal audit programme itself. Examples include if the audit schedule is not\nproperly implemented or if corrective and preventive actions are not completed within the agreed timescales. Where the\nsite consistently obtains negative results (i.e. no non\n\n- conformities are identified throughout the scheduled programme) good practice is to review the programme to ensure it is\noperating robustly; for example, to:\n\n- consider if all activities are correctly incorporated into the programme\n\n- review rigour, robustness and consistency of the internal audits.\n\nFull records of all internal audits and the results, including conformities and non\n\n- conformities and verification of corrective and preventive actions, must be kept for a defined period, typically 2\nyears.

    "interpretation_guidance": "Documented inspections In addition to the internal audit programme the Standard requires a programme of documented\ninspections to ensure that the factory environment and processing equipment are maintained in a suitable condition.\nThese inspections are different from the internal audit programme specified in clauses 3.4.1 to 3.4.3, which examines\npractices against documented procedures. Audits are an in\n\n- depth challenge to the systems and procedures that a site has put in place to manage hazards, to confirm that the site\nis effectively mitigating identified risks. A documented inspection, however, is a simpler approach to assessing the\nconditions present, so an entirely separate inspection plan should be in place. These hygiene\n\n- and fabrication\n\n- based inspections assess standards of cleaning, equipment, building fabrication and personal hygiene to ensure that high\nstandards are maintained and that a safe, hygienic production environment is in place. For example, inspections should\ninclude:\n\n- appropriateness, status, state of repair and cleaning of doors, walls, floors and other fabrication and facilities (e.g.\nthose detailed in section 4.4)\n\n- hygiene inspection to confirm equipment and facilities have been suitably cleaned\n\n- equipment inspection to identify and control potential foreign bodies (e.g. from worn or damaged equipment) before they\nhave the opportunity to contaminate a product. The frequency of the inspections should be based on risk. For open\nproduct areas, inspections need to be at least monthly, whereas inspections in high\n\n- care and high\n\n- risk areas are likely to be more frequent (e.g. daily or weekly); seasonal products or activities should be included\nwhere appropriate. Line start\n\n- up checks, which may occur daily or at shift changes in many operations, can form part of this inspection programme. It\nis also good practice to complete inspections after any activities that potentially change the risk to products; for\nexample, after maintenance. A review of the inspection programme should be completed prior to any changes which may\naffect food safety; for example:\n\n- introducing new equipment or facilities\n\n- changes to products\n\n- changes to processing conditions or process flow\n\n- following a non\n\n- conformity in an audit (e.g. internal, BRCGS, customer, or regulatory audit) or an independent inspection (e.g.\nfollowing recommendations for improvement from the pest control in\n\n- depth survey). The individuals responsible for completing these inspections should be suitably trained for the systems\nthey are checking. However, staff completing hygiene and fabrication inspections do not need the same level of training\nas internal auditors. The absolute requirements for independence identified in clause 3.4.2 do not always apply to these\ninspections; for example, it would be acceptable for line start\n\n- up checks to be carried out by line supervisors or managers. External agencies may be used to carry out inspections. It\nis important that issues identified at the inspections are corrected as soon as possible so that product risk is\nminimised. The records of inspections and corrective actions must be retained. Inspection records can provide useful\ninformation to identify trends and drive improvements (e.g. through the use of scored inspection results). To facilitate\nthis, and to promote discussions about improvements to hygiene and fabrication, a summary of the results will be\ndiscussed at the management review meetings (see clause 1.1.4)."

    "interpretation_guidance": "Documented supplier approval and monitoring system All suppliers must be evaluated for their ability to meet the\nspecifications of the materials (ingredients and primary packaging) they are supplying and requirements for safety,\nquality and legality. The company must document its procedure for supplier approval and monitoring. This needs to\ninclude the methods of approval, frequency of monitoring, responsibilities and how the process will be managed. The\nacceptable methods of supplier approval will depend on the raw material and the risks associated with it (e.g. the\noutput of clause 3.5.1.1). They will include one or more of the following activities:\n\n- Certification to the relevant BRCGS Standard, such as the Global Standard Food Safety; Packaging Materials; Storage and\nDistribution; Agents and Brokers; or another of the GFSI\n\n- benchmarked schemes. The site must confirm the validity of the certification. This will include:\n\n- Confirmation of the certification status (e.g. this can be confirmed on an independent database; for BRCGS Standards it\ncan be confirmed in the BRCGS Directory). Photocopies of certificates are not recommended and on their own are not\nconsidered suitable validation of certification status. During the BRCGS audit the site may be asked to demonstrate its\nvalidation process.\n\nInterpretation continued\n\n- Confirmation that the certification remains up to date (e.g. by receiving confirmation of successful completion of the\nrecertification processes or by recording certificate expiry dates and completing checks for ongoing certification).\n\n- Ensuring that the raw materials are within the scope of the certification. Where the product has been excluded from the\nscope of certification it cannot be assumed that all of the processes relating to its manufacture have been conducted in\naccordance with the certification requirements. For example, different facilities or equipment may be used; different\nraw material suppliers or risk assessment; or different staff training. Therefore the site will need to undertake\nadditional supplier approval processes to ensure the material is satisfactory and any risks are appropriately managed. A\nsuccessful site audit covers at a minimum product safety, traceability, HACCP, product security and the food defence\nplan (i.e. systems to protect the product from theft and malicious activity), product authenticity and good\nmanufacturing processes. This audit must be completed by an appropriately experienced and competent auditor (i.e.\nsomeone who has completed training in auditing techniques, has experience of auditing, and has knowledge of the product,\ningredient or processes being audited). Non\n\n- conformities should be addressed (e.g. in an agreed action plan with timescales) unless they are critical to product\nsafety or legality, in which case supply should not be permitted until the non\n\n- conformities have been satisfactorily addressed. When deciding the type of supplier audit to complete the company should\nconsider the risks associated with the raw material and supplier, using this information to decide the format and\nduration of the audit, and whether the risk assessment indicates that some or all of the requirements can be completed\nremotely, or whether an entirely on\n\n- site audit is required. If the raw material supplier is independently audited to another standard that is not GFSI\n\n- benchmarked, this may be acceptable as an alternative to the site completing its own audit of the supplier providing\nthat:\n\n- the scope of the audit meets the requirements of the Standard (i.e. at a minimum product safety, traceability, HACCP\nreview, product security and food defence, food authenticity and good manufacturing practices)\n\n- the site has a copy of the full audit report (not just a certificate)\n\n- the supplier can demonstrate the competence of the auditor. Where risk assessment (completed as part of this clause)\nindicates that a supplier is low risk (e.g. due to history of trading with the site or the nature of the raw materials\ntraded) the completion of a supplier questionnaire with a focus on food safety and quality may be sufficient. If a\nsupplier questionnaire is the only mechanism used to assess a supplier (i.e. there are no additional activities such as\nsupplier audits) then it is important that the questionnaire (and replies from the ingredient supplier) contains all the\nrelevant information to allow the site to confidently make a decision on approval. The auditor will expect to see, and\nwill challenge, risk assessments. Approval and the associated risk assessments must be up to date. The site should\ntherefore consider reviewing the assessment whenever there is a significant change (e.g. new suppliers, new countries of\norigin or new materials).\n\nClause Requirements"

    "interpretation_guidance": "Purchasing from agents and brokers Potential product safety risks need to be understood for all raw materials, including\nthose that have been purchased through an agent or broker (see glossary). The purpose of this clause is therefore to\nensure that essential information relating to traceability, product safety, authenticity, food defence, etc. is\nmaintained and relevant details communicated, where a site has purchased a raw material from an agent or broker, or a\nwholesaler (i.e. not the manufacturer, packer or consolidator). The site will need sufficient information to:\n\n- ensure traceability\n\n- enable timely action in the event of an incident in the supply chain\n\n- enable the approval of the last processor of the raw material, the last point of packing or the consolidation place for\nbulk commodity products, as described in clause 3.5.1.2. The Standard is not prescriptive on the methods of\ncommunication used, and this information may be provided directly by the manufacturer, processor, packer or consolidator\nor alternatively through the agent or broker, depending on the contractual arrangements for data handling and\ncommunication agreed between the site and the agent/broker. For the purposes of the Standard, a place of consolidation\nof bulk materials is a location where a number of smaller batches are mixed to form a single bulk material (e.g. where a\nnumber of farms supply grain, which the grain merchant combines in a silo before sale, or where a cooperative arranges\nfor a group of small growers to combine their crops for onward sale to customers). The important difference between\nconsolidation and other types of storage or trade of materials is the mixing or combining of materials from multiple\nsources or batches, so that it is no longer possible to identify the individual supplier/batch for any specific portion\nof the bulk material (of course, for traceability purposes, it must still be possible to identify all of the\nsuppliers/batches contributing to the bulk). Therefore, where a trader receives individually traceable units of product\n(e.g. sacks of material), each of which can be individually traced from supplier to customer, this does not count as a\nplace of consolidation. The bulk material may be sold to one customer or divided and sold to multiple customers.\n\nWhere the agent or broker is certificated to the Global Standard Agents and Brokers, the wholesale module of the Global\nStandard Storage and Distribution, the relevant traded products/goods scope of the Global Standard Food Safety or Global\nStandard Packaging Materials, or a GFSI\n\n- benchmarked equivalent, then the site simply needs to know the identity of the manufacturer, packer or place of\nconsolidation of the material (i.e. the location/company where the material underwent the last process other than\nstorage or distribution). In this situation, the requirement to approve the processor, packer or consolidator is not\napplicable, as the requirements of these Standards ensure that effective systems for supplier approval and traceability\nare in place. However, the site will still be expected to know the identity of the processor, packer or consolidator."

    "interpretation_guidance": "Supply chain traceability It is important for the integrity of products that appropriate traceability systems operate\nthroughout the supply chain. Therefore sites must ensure that their raw material suppliers (including primary packaging\nsuppliers) have suitable traceability systems in operation. This assurance can be obtained from certification, auditing\nor by directly testing traceability. Examples of acceptable traceability include:\n\n- The raw material supplier is certificated to a GFSI\n\n- benchmarked standard. Assessment of traceability systems forms part of these audits and therefore no additional action\nis required to comply with the requirements of this clause; however, a communication mechanism should be in place, such\nthat if the raw material supplier were no longer certificated, the site would be made aware of this change.\n\n- The raw material supplier is audited by the site and the audit includes an assessment of the traceability systems. This\nwould comply with the requirement as traceability has been assessed. The audit should be repeated at least every 3\nyears.\n\n- Verification of a supplier’s traceability system where approval has been based solely on a questionnaire with no\nadditional testing (unless the raw material is a primary agricultural product purchased directly from a farm or fishery,\nwhere additional testing of the traceability systems is not mandatory). This verification could include, for example:\n\n- A test of the raw material supplier’s traceability. For example, as part of the site’s traceability test (see clause\n3.9.3), a relevant ingredient is highlighted. The ingredient and batch details are forwarded to the supplier to enable\nthem to complete the traceability test for the specific batch of raw materials and forward the relevant records back to\nthe site.\n\nInterpretation continued\n\n- A worked example from the raw material supplier, which clearly explains the traceability process.\n\n- A detailed description of the traceability system provided by the raw material supplier. Information received during the\ntraceability verification should be incorporated into the supplier approval process (clause 3.5.1.2). Where the supplier\nis not the manufacturer, packer or consolidator of the raw material (e.g. purchased from an agent, broker or wholesaler)\nand approval is based on a questionnaire instead of certification or audit, the verification of the traceability system\nrequired by this clause shall be carried out on the last manufacturer, packer or consolidator of the raw material.\nTherefore, where the:\n\n- agent/broker is certificated to a BRCGS Standard or a standard benchmarked by GFSI, the assessment of supplier approval\nforms part of these audits and therefore no additional action is required to comply with the requirements of this clause\n(see clause 3.5.1.5 for further information)\n\n- last manufacturer, packer or consolidator is certificated to a BRCGS Standard or a standard benchmarked by GFSI, the\nassessment of supplier approval forms part of these audits and therefore no additional action is required to comply with\nthe requirements of this clause\n\n- last manufacturer, packer or consolidator is audited as part of the supplier approval process, and the audit includes an\nassessment of the traceability systems, this would comply with the requirement as traceability has been assessed.\nTraceability verification is a requirement for each raw material supplier. Therefore any traceability test (because the\nsupplier approval is based solely on a questionnaire) should be designed to test the raw material supplier’s systems and\nnot to trace every single material they produce. Where a site purchases multiple ingredients from the same raw material\nsupplier, it is not a requirement to complete a traceability test for every single ingredient purchased; only to\ncomplete the traceability test for each supplier from which ingredients are purchased. The frequency of the traceability\nverification should link to the supplier approval programme; that is, the traceability is verified on first approval of\nthe supplier, and then at least every 3 years. It is good practice to phase these verifications over the 3\n\n- year period rather than trying to complete them for all sites at once. Therefore sites that are new to certification\n(i.e. at their initial audit) may not have fully completed the traceability assessment for all of their suppliers, but\nshould be able to demonstrate verification of the traceability system for at least a third of the suppliers in the first\nyear, prioritising the higher\n\n- risk materials; two\n\n- thirds completed within the second year; and all suppliers by the third year. During the BRCGS audit the auditor will\nnot undertake a test of raw material suppliers’ traceability systems but they will review the site’s processes and the\ninformation received from its raw material suppliers. Issues arise with raw materials from time to time so it is\nbeneficial to consider the monitoring of any materials that may need further transparency within the supply chain. This\nensures that the site is proactive, not reactive, potentially mitigating the risk of future concerns about raw\nmaterials.\n\nClause Requirements"

    "interpretation_guidance": "Management of corrective actions There must be a documented procedure for handling issues in the food safety and quality\nsystem which have a potential adverse effect on product safety, authenticity, legality or quality. All issues or non\n\n- conformities generated by the site (e.g. non\n\n- conforming product, internal audits and site inspections, third\n\n- party audits or customer complaints, product recalls, product testing (including inspections, quality assurance tests\nand laboratory testing)) must be subject to corrective action. Good practice is for corrective action to be completed as\nsoon after detecting the non\n\n- conformity as possible (this is particularly important where the non\n\n- conformity could affect product safety, legality or quality – see clause 3.7.2). An important part of an effective\ncorrective action process is the identification of the root or underlying cause of the non\n\n- conformity and the implementation of suitable action to prevent recurrence. Root cause analysis is a process of\nconducting an investigation into an identified problem to allow the investigator(s) to understand the fundamental cause\nand put it right. While there are a number of techniques for undertaking root cause analysis, one of the most common and\nsimplest to use is the ‘five whys’ technique. The technique is based on repeatedly digging deeper into the cause of a\nproblem by asking ‘Why …?’ to get to the root of the issue. Usually, the root cause becomes evident after five steps,\nbut this is not fixed and further investigation should be completed where required. This is described in more detail in\nthe example in clause 3.7.2. Some clauses in the Standard specifically require root cause analysis but it is up to the\nsite to establish a procedure for its completion. Root cause analysis procedures should include:\n\n- a set of parameters that will initiate the use of an appropriate tool (i.e. the site must define when the analysis will\nbe completed if it is not already prescribed by the Standard)\n\n- who is trained and/or authorised to complete the analysis\n\n- the methods that the site will use to conduct the analysis\n\n- the records which detail the analysis and any subsequent preventive actions\n\n- the methods for the verification of the completed actions. The auditor will expect to see a documented procedure that\nincludes this information, as well as evidence of any root cause analysis and preventive action that the site has\ncarried out. It is worth noting that in some geographies the analysis of trends may be a legal requirement. For example,\nin the EU, the Microbiological Criteria for Foodstuffs (EC) No 2073/2005 states that food business operators (FBOs)\nshall analyse trends in test results. When they observe a trend towards unsatisfactory results, they shall take\nappropriate actions without undue delay to remedy the situation in order to prevent the occurrence of microbiological\nrisks."

Action needs to be undertaken as soon as possible after the detection of the non\n\n- conformity, but there may also be a need for long\n\n- term action to prevent further occurrence of the non\n\n- conformity. All actions undertaken must be documented. The records will include:\n\n- details of the non\n\n- conformity and when it occurred or was identified\n\n- assessment of the potential consequences of the non\n\n- conformity by a suitably competent and authorised person\n\n- details of the action taken to address the immediate issue and dates or timescales for completion of the actions (i.e.\ncorrective action)\n\n- root cause analysis to identify the fundamental or root cause of the non\n\n- conformity\n\n- details of the preventive action taken to address the root cause and dates or timescales for completion of the actions\n\n- identification of who is authorised and responsible for the actions\n\n- details of the verification checks to ensure the action has been implemented and is effective. Where there is a\nsignificant trend in a specific type of non\n\n- conformity, root cause analysis must be used to investigate the trend and implement action to prevent recurrence. All\ncorrective actions should be completed in a timely fashion. In practice this will depend on the nature of the activity\nand the potential consequences of a delay. For example, stopping the production line would happen immediately but\nreceiving and fitting a new or replacement part may be a prolonged process. The actions should be included in a regular\nreview of activities and systems. The site must assess the consequences of any delay in action and ensure that product\nintegrity and safety are not jeopardised. Where set timescales are not met, the reason for the delay should be recorded\nand reviewed by the appropriate site management to ensure ongoing product safety and, where necessary, provide\nappropriate resources.\n\nClause Requirements Example Root cause analysis using the ‘five whys’ technique An operator is instructed to perform a\nsimple action, ‘Weigh out ingredient A’. However, the operator inadvertently uses ingredient B instead. The immediate\nreaction would probably be that this was operator error. Although this may be accurate, it does not establish the reason\nwhy the error occurred or prevent it from happening in the future. Using the five whys technique, the root cause\nanalysis should ask and answer a series of questions:\n\n- Why did the operator make the error? The operator was unfamiliar with the procedure.\n\n- Why was an operator who was unfamiliar with the procedure asked to complete it? He had been trained but there was no\nsupervision or sign\n\n- off of the training to confirm it was satisfactory.\n\n- Why was the training not satisfactory? The two ingredients looked identical.\n\n- Why weren’t the ingredients clearly labelled? The labels had been removed during cleaning and not replaced.\n\n- Why weren’t the labels replaced? The cleaning staff did not consider the significance of the delay or the potential for\nan error.\n\n- Why were the ingredient containers being used if they had not been set up correctly for manufacture? Checking the labels\ndid not form part of anyone’s duties. The conclusion of a root cause analysis should be to identify what should be\nchanged to prevent recurrence of the error. In this example, the conclusion might be to:\n\n- update the training procedure\n\n- introduce a training sign\n\n- off procedure to ensure training is understood\n\n- replace labels – if practical, with ones that cannot be removed. Where labels must be removed occasionally, ensure that\npost\n\n- maintenance line checks include a check of signage\n\n- ensure that an individual (e.g. the production manager) is authorised and responsible for post\n\n- cleaning line sign\n\n- off\n\n- ensure that cleaning staff fully understand and are trained in the need to return labelling (and all equipment) to a\nfully operational state. Now that the root cause analysis has been completed, it is easy to see how this incident\noccurred. The causes were:\n\n- an incomplete training procedure\n\n- a faulty cleaning process\n\n- lack of post\n\n- cleaning check procedures. The next step of the process is for the site to identify and implement suitable preventive\naction to ensure the problem does not occur again (where a non\n\n- conformity has multiple causes it is important that the preventive action addresses all of these). For example:\n\n- update the training procedure to ensure sign\n\n- off ( and possibly a supervision step)\n\n- replace ingredient labels ideally with ones that cannot be removed\n\n- if labels must occasionally be removed, ensure that post\n\n- cleaning line checks include a signage check\n\n- ensure an individual is authorised and responsible for post\n\n- cleaning line sign\n\n- off\n\n- ensure cleaners fully understand and are trained in the need to return labelling (and all equipment) in a fully\noperational state.

    "interpretation_guidance": "Identification of raw materials and finished product Products and materials may be identified by physical labelling, by\nrecording systems identifying the allocation of materials to production or mixing areas, or through the use of\ncomputerised bar\n\n- coding systems. The level of traceability may need to be agreed between the company and its customers, but the system\nused must be capable of linking all raw material lot codes to finished product codes. This will enable finished product\nto be identified if a particular batch of raw material needs to be recalled. The limitations of any system must be\nrecognised, as can be demonstrated by the problems associated with bulk storage. Products such as sugar may be delivered\nwith clear batch identification; however, if they are emptied into a single storage tank that is mixed with earlier\ndeliveries, the reduction in accurate traceability is compounded by the potential for product to be trapped in dead\nzones during filling and emptying. If a particular delivery is identified as being contaminated, the entire product in\nthe storage tank would need to be disposed of, as well as several lot codes of finished product, as the company would\nnot be able to identify the specific batch of finished product that contained the contaminated material. A similar\nlimitation will exist if recyclable packaging is collected from several sources and combined to form a single batch.\n\nThe traceability system needs to include primary packaging (a full definition of primary packaging is available in the\nglossary, Appendix 1). Note that processing aids (i.e. substances that are used within the process but are not required\nto be declared as an ingredient, such as sodium alginate for the clarification of beer) are included in the definition\nof raw materials (see glossary, Appendix 1) and therefore need to be included in the traceability system. All test\nresults (clause 3.9.3) must be traceable to specific batches of product or ingredient. Consider how the traceability\nsystem operates in practice (with the effective physical identification of ingredients and products). For example, if\nbulk containers are labelled, consider how the information is presented to ensure it is legible and accurate. Common non\n\n- conformities include the ineffective labelling of part\n\n- used packs in production, work in progress, and storage areas leading to potential errors. Strict controls on material\nidentification, traceability and segregation are also required to preserve the integrity of any claims made, such as\norganic status. Where logos are used that make specific claims about production systems (e.g. farm assurance), full\ntraceability must be demonstrated (see also section 5.4). Apart from batch or lot codes, traceability information will\nusually include date codes to ensure that only ingredients, intermediates and products within the appropriate shelf\n\n- life period are used. Particular care is needed for decanted ingredients, work in progress and products stored in bulk\nwhere the packaging has been removed."

The test shall occur at a\npredetermined frequency, at a minimum annually, and results shall be retained for\ninspection. Traceability should be achievable within 4 hours.",
    "interpretation_guidance": "Tests of the traceability system Good practice is for the site to have a procedure or document that highlights the\ntraceability system that is used at each step in the production process. It could include, for example, how incoming raw\nmaterial batch numbers are captured, and how the outgoing product is traced and labelled. The process flow diagram\ndeveloped as part of the HACCP plan (see clause 2.5.1) may be useful to ensure all steps are captured. The site’s\ntraceability system must be tested at least annually, or more frequently if required by a customer. (Note that the\nfrequency of traceability tests relating to provenance and origin claims is covered separately in clause 5.4.5.) Where\ntraceability for all products manufactured by the site is the same or similar, then a minimum of one traceability test a\nyear must be completed. However, if there are significant differences or specific traceability challenges relating to\none product or group of products, additional tests specifically related to that product or group of products may be\nneeded. Traceability testing may be completed as part of a real product recall or withdrawal scenario if one has\noccurred, since the objective is to test the system and identify areas for improvement, rather than supply records of a\n‘test’ for its own sake.\n\nInterpretation continued The system must provide traceability forwards and backwards; therefore the system should be\ntested in both directions. For example, a raw material could be selected and traced forwards to show in which finished\nproducts it was used. A finished product should also be selected and traced backwards to show all the raw material batch\ncodes (including primary packaging) that were used to produce it. The tests should include identifying which customers\nreceived the finished products and which suppliers provided the raw materials. The traceability test must also include\nthe traceability of the primary packaging materials. Although there are many benefits to complete supply chain\ntraceability (i.e. from the farm through all stages of processing, distribution and storage, through to the retailer or\nfood service company), this clause does not require sites to complete full supply chain traceability tests. The scope of\nthe traceability test required here is from the suppliers of the raw material, through the site’s processes, to the\nsite’s customers. The site is also expected to compile a summary of the documents that should be referenced during the\ntest, and clearly show the links between them. This is of benefit to both the site and the auditor, as it ensures all\nrelevant documents are retrieved, and explains the traceability system. The test of traceability should be timed and\nfull traceability would be expected to be achieved within 4 hours. This is to reflect the need for rapid traceability in\nthe event of a recall. Where traceability takes longer than 4 hours, review the areas where the retrieval of information\nis slow in order to identify improvements. For all food products, and printed packaging and labels which have product\nsafety information, the tests must also include a quantity check or mass balance exercise. It is not expected that the\nfull mass balance exercise would always be achievable within 4 hours. The objective is to be able to account for the\nusage of a full batch of a raw material. This helps to ensure that the traceability systems are capable of operating\neffectively should a product recall be required based on the recall of an ingredient. The mass balance exercise is\nusually undertaken as follows:\n\n- Select a batch code of a particular specific raw material.\n\n- Identify the quantity of the raw material supplied under that batch code.\n\n- Identify the recipes in which the ingredient is used.\n\n- Use production schedules and batch make\n\n- up sheets to calculate the quantities of the selected batch of ingredient used in each product.\n\n- Calculate the quantity of any unused part of the batch in the warehouse.\n\n- Reconcile the quantity delivered against the amounts used plus any residual unused stock. In some instances quantity\nchecks may take a great deal of time and resource to complete successfully. It is unlikely that the mass balance\nexercise will be able to account for all materials to 100% accuracy. However, the company needs to justify any\ndiscrepancies and demonstrate understanding of the nature of the variance. This may be inherent in the product\ncharacteristics (e.g. dehydration of fresh ingredients), or be ascribed to typical wastage on equipment or portion\nvariances. Where the site adds subsequent deliveries to a bulk silo, the test should clearly show how this has been\nmanaged. The principle is to ensure that the traceability system is effective. Mass balance is a key measure of its\nworkability and highlights areas for improvement.\n\nDuring the BRCGS audit, the auditor will ask the site to complete at least one ‘vertical’ audit. At a minimum this will\ninclude the traceability of a specific batch of product or ingredient through the site’s production, processing and\ndistribution processes, and a review of the site records related to the product or ingredient. Records will include, for\nexample, supplier approval, goods receipt, process records (such as temperature monitoring), metal detector checks and\ndispatch records. However, the vertical audit is not expected to include records that would only be held at other points\nin the supply chain (e.g. the raw material supplier’s processing records). This vertical audit is in addition to the\nreview of the site’s own traceability tests. The final audit report will include a summary of the vertical audit\nresults. The vertical audit will also include a mass balance exercise and a review of the systems relating to the\naccuracy of labelling (clause 5.2.1). Further information on the content of the audit, including the vertical audit, can\nbe obtained from BRCGS’ auditing techniques document. This may be viewed online at BRCGS Participate. BRCGS publishes a\nseparate best\n\n- practice guideline on traceability, which may be purchased from the BRCGS Store or viewed online at BRCGS Participate."

    "interpretation_guidance": "Monitoring of gases and steam Compressed air, steam or gases used as an ingredient or directly in contact with food must\nbe monitored to ensure they do not contaminate the product. The main risks to consider are: the carry\n\n- over of boiler water\n\n- treatment chemicals in steam; dust particles in compressed air; and oil used as a lubricant in compressed\n\n- air systems. The level of monitoring needs to be based on an assessment of potential risk. Steam generated from potable\nwater free from additives, for instance, is not likely to present a risk. Compressed air in direct contact with products\nneeds to be filtered prior to use, and the filters checked and maintained to ensure they remain effective. The gauge of\nfiltration (e.g. mesh size) and frequency of checks should be documented and based on risk assessment, taking into\naccount the source of the air, the type of compressors used and the condition of the pipework (e.g. evidence of\ncorrosion). The compressor suppliers or experts should be consulted to establish any potential risks and any necessary\ntesting. The objective of using filters is to prevent dust particles and lubricating oil from the compression system\ncontaminating the products. Therefore a single central filter, in close proximity to the compressor, but remote from the\nfood\n\n- related use of the compressed air, is unlikely to provide sufficient product protection. The site must be able to\njustify the effectiveness of the filtration system employed. If gases are used, such as in modified atmosphere packing,\nthey must be demonstrated as being of an appropriate quality. Usually such gases are supplied in a compressed form in\nmetal cylinders and the supplier management process (approved suppliers and specifications, with certificates of\nconformance if required) would be sufficient. In these circumstances, the site would not be expected to undertake its\nown checks. Compressed gases are generally considered to be microbiologically safe and the Standard does not require\nroutine testing of such gases unless a specific risk has been identified. There may be additional risks where gases are\nproduced on site and these would need to be evaluated through a risk assessment. Additional information can be obtained\nfrom the British Compressed Air Society and the European Industrial Gases Association."

It does\nnot include small parts such as screws or other non\n\n- food contact fixings. Purchase specifications need to contain sufficient information to ensure product safety and\nsuitability of the equipment. This means that the actual amount of detail in the purchase specification will be\ndependent on the type of equipment being purchased. For example, a simple plastic scoop is only likely to need a very\nsimple set of user requirements, with minimal food hazards identified, whereas a new production line is likely to\nrequire significantly more details regarding, for example, product types, production rates and food contact\nrequirements. Purchase specifications usually include:\n\n- reference to any relevant legislation\n\n- requirements for food contact surfaces (i.e. where product will be in contact with the equipment)\n\n- intended use of the equipment\n\n- types of materials that will be used (this is particularly important for food contact surfaces, since potential\nmigration from equipment may be affected by the composition of the food material, e.g. high fat or acidic materials can\nincrease potential for migration).

For re\n\n- purchases of simple equipment, this may be simply a case of identifying who is authorised to order the product; however,\nfor complex machinery (such as a new production line), there may need to be input from multiple departments, such as\nengineering, technical, hygiene and finance. This is to ensure that all critical food safety requirements have been\nconsidered and included within the specification. Note that where equipment is purchased from suppliers in other regions\nor countries, legislative requirements may vary, and additional communication of requirements may facilitate the\npurchasing process. The site should retain evidence of the specification developed, and evidence provided from the\nsupplier demonstrating that the equipment meets these requirements, as this provides evidence of due diligence in the\nevent of a challenge or incident. During the BRCGS audit, the auditor will expect to see evidence of the purchase\nspecification for any new equipment, the specification’s suitability for the specific equipment, equipment purchase\nmatching the specification, and, as detailed in clauses 4.6.2–4.6.7, commissioning of equipment, hygiene requirements,\nroutine maintenance, etc. Note that the clause relates to the purchase of new equipment. It does not require a site to\nretrospectively develop specifications for equipment that was purchased prior to the publication of the Standard, or\nprior to its decision to become certificated for the first time."

    "interpretation_guidance": "Equipment in direct contact with food The aim of this requirement is to ensure that equipment is not a source of product\ncontamination, and that it complies with relevant food contact legislation where such legislation exists (for example,\nin the EU, the Food Contact Materials – Regulation (EC) 1935/2004 and its subsequent amendments). The clause provides\nsome examples of potential issues, including:\n\n- Food contact surfaces should be smooth and impervious; for example, to prevent accumulation of material that could lead\nto microbiological or allergen contamination of the product.\n\n- Welds and joints should form a flat surface (again to prevent microbiological or allergen contamination). Other well\n\n- documented issues have included the purchase of equipment (especially plastic items) not designed for food use leading\nto the migration of chemicals into food products. The company must consider the risks associated with the equipment\n(including any risks associated with its design, construction and installation) and ensure that significant risks have\nbeen controlled. This can, for example, be achieved by use of a hygienic design risk assessment, which uses hygienic\ndesign principles to consider the risks of foreign\n\n- body, microbiological, allergen or chemical contamination of the product. Before using the equipment, the company will\nneed to have evidence that the risks have been considered, and of the suitability of the equipment, and must confirm its\nacceptability for food contact surfaces. For new equipment, this will usually form part of the purchase specification\nprocess (see clause 4.6.1). Where such evidence is not available (for example, when purchasing second\n\n- hand equipment) and the contact material is not a recognised food\n\n- safe material (such as certain grades of stainless steel), an additional assessment should be carried out to ensure safe\nuse and to prevent food safety risks. The risk assessment should consider factors such as:\n\n- the nature of the food contact surface and its known characteristics\n\n- the length of contact time with the food\n\n- the nature of the food and its potential for contamination (e.g. fatty or acidic foods are often at increased risk from\nmigration of contaminants from plastic materials). During the BRCGS audit, the auditor will not inspect every seal, bolt\nor food contact surface, but will:\n\n- need to understand the site processes; for example, they may review the documented process and their suitability,\nwhether they have been used in practice, and the completeness of relevant records\n\n- inspect a small number of relevant examples of equipment where there is a food safety or quality implication; this may,\nfor example, be completed during the inspection of equipment hygiene (see clause 4.11.1)."

The hazards associated with any specific item of equipment will vary considerably dependent on the\nnature of the equipment and its intended use. Using the previous example, a new plastic scoop is likely to require\nminimal commissioning, whereas a completely new production line is likely to require an extensive commissioning process.\nTherefore the commissioning procedure should be risk\n\n- based, allowing the site the flexibility to complete the appropriate activities for the specific equipment. Examples of\ncommissioning activity might include installation and sign\n\n- off of equipment, trials operating the equipment, cleaning validation and maintenance checks. In order to facilitate\nroutine cleaning, operation, inspection and servicing, equipment must be appropriately positioned (e.g. access provided\nunder, inside and around it). Where equipment is permanently sited, it should be properly secured and sealed to the\nfloor to prevent the accumulation of food debris underneath, where it cannot be cleaned. It has been well documented\nthat, where equipment or fixtures allow organic matter and/or pathogens to collect and survive, this can subsequently\ncause product contamination as pathogens such as Salmonella or Listeria can survive for prolonged periods in these\nconditions if left undisturbed. The site must ensure that the safety and integrity of product is not jeopardised during\ninstallation (e.g. equipment is not contaminated either by products used during installation such as sealants, nuts and\nbolts; by lubricants; or by packaging that has been removed from the equipment). Good practice is to schedule\ninstallation of larger or more complex equipment outside production hours. Where this is not practicable, suitable\nprecautions must be taken to prevent contamination of products; for example, the use of screening to protect adjacent\nproduction lines.\n\nFollowing installation, equipment must be cleaned and inspected prior to use. An authorised member of staff (e.g. the\nproduction manager) is required to formally accept equipment into operation following this inspection, to confirm that\nall relevant installation, commissioning and cleaning activities have been completed satisfactorily. Records need to be\nmaintained (e.g. signing the appropriate engineering record or line start\n\n- up check sheet) to demonstrate that the equipment has been inspected and is acceptable for use. The commissioning\nprocedure must include the updating of any other relevant site procedures that are affected by the new equipment; for\nexample, training, operating procedures, cleaning, environmental monitoring, maintenance schedules or internal audits.\nThis is to ensure that all staff have access to the relevant procedures and understand how to complete their activities\ncorrectly.

Where hot food is prepared within a site’s\nfacilities, additional safe food\n\n- handling may be required; for example, the WHO’s Five Keys to Safer Food Manual promoting safe food\n\n- handling highlights the need to:\n\n- keep clean – wash hands and keep kitchens and food preparation areas washed and sanitised\n\n- separate raw and cooked foodstuffs, and keep the utensils or equipment used for handling them separated\n\n- cook or reheat products thoroughly\n\n- store food at appropriate temperatures to maintain food safety; for example, using fridges and freezers, and keeping\ncooked food hot before serving\n\n- use water of an appropriate quality to ensure that it is not the source of a food safety hazard. The Standard requires\nsites to consider whether there are risks of product contamination from catering activities and vending machines, and,\nwhere appropriate, ensure that suitable company policies are in place to manage these risks. For example, in some\noperations (e.g. sites manufacturing a product with an allergen\n\n- free claim), specific allergens may present a particular risk. These sites should specify any relevant company policies\nto confectionery vending suppliers and catering facilities. At the BRCGS audit, there will be a basic inspection of the\nkitchen facilities.

Procedures must cover unused chemicals (i.e. those\nthat are no longer required) and empty containers. Chemicals that are likely to come into direct contact with foods when\nused as intended (e.g. materials such as oils or lubricants used on machinery), as well as terminal sanitisers that are\ndesigned to be used without rinsing with water, should be confirmed as suitable for food use.

(The list could also detail the frequency with\nwhich the items must be checked.)\n\n- recorded, routine inspections to verify the condition of these items. Inspections must be carried out at a specified\nfrequency based on risk assessment; some areas may be checked more frequently than others because of their potential to\nform a foreign\n\n- body hazard in the product. (For example, a factory identifies part of the production line which has plastic\n\n- laminated line covers that may chip or break. The condition of this section of the line is specifically checked daily\nprior to production, because it is above open food and any breakage or damage is likely to result in a foreign\n\n- body issue. The same factory has a brittle plastic dial cover on a control panel on the exterior of a piece of equipment\nnot close to open product. This is checked only monthly, as a break and subsequent foreign\n\n- body issue is unlikely to arise.)\n\n- maintaining a record of the inspection even when there is no change in the condition of the inspected items. Any non\n\n- conformities highlighted in previous inspections, but not permanently repaired, should also be checked to confirm no\nadditional deterioration has occurred\n\n- the procedures that allow cleaning or replacement of items in a way that minimises potential risk to products (e.g.\nreplacing bulbs in fly\n\n- killing devices). Further guidance Developing an effective glass control programme To start with, carry out an\nassessment of the glass and brittle plastic items in open product areas and, wherever possible, remove them (see clause\n4.9.3.1). If the item cannot be removed, it must be protected against breakage (e.g. with adhesive sheets or\nreinforcements) and included on a register for inspection purposes (an example is shown in Figure 15). When creating a\nlist of items for inspection, it is important to be realistic. The objective is to create a list of items that represent\na real risk of breakage and product contamination. For example, the window above the production line is likely to be\nhigh\n\n- risk, as any breakage is likely to contaminate the product. But the window in the Director’s office, on the other side\nof the site, does not need to be included unless there is a genuine risk of product contamination if the window breaks.\n\nFurther guidance continued The frequency of the inspections must be based on risk assessment. The quality of the risk\nassessment is important as some items will probably be checked infrequently because of their lower risk status, whereas\nothers may require frequent checks because of their prominent location and associated risk. For example, checking the\nwindow above the production line is likely to form part of the daily line start\n\n- up procedures. You must ensure you have a contingency procedure in place that allows the reporting and timely management\nof any breakage (i.e. if an item is found to be damaged or broken during an inspection or if an item breaks during use).\nThere are a number of risk assessment techniques that can be used within food sites and the Standard is not prescriptive\nabout which should be selected. However, there are two key considerations in relation to glass and brittle materials:\n\n- the potential for damage or breakage\n\n- the location and consequently the likelihood of a broken fragment contaminating a food product. The importance of good\ndocumentation and record\n\n- keeping Five key documents are required:\n\n- a list of items giving details of their location, number, type and condition\n\n- a risk assessment defining the required frequency of checks\n\n- records of the routine inspections to verify the condition of these items (see examples in Figures 16 and 17)\n\n- procedures that allow the cleaning or replacement of items in a way that minimises potential risk to products\n\n- a procedure for the management of any breakages (see clause 4.9.3.3). A record of the checks must be maintained even\nwhen there is no change to the status of the item (see examples in Figure 16 and 17). This is to demonstrate that the\nchecks were made, so that in the event of a breakage you can be confident that the item was intact at the previous\nscheduled inspection, allowing any investigation or action to focus on a defined time period.

Its absence would normally only be based on\nthe use of an alternative, more effective, method of protection (e.g. the use of X\n\n- ray, fine sieves or filtration). There will, however, be situations where metal detection does not, on the basis of risk\nassessment, provide any significant additional protection to the consumer; for example, where whole pieces of fresh\nproduce (e.g. potatoes) are being washed and packed, and any metal contamination would be obvious to the consumer prior\nto consumption. Where metal detectors are not used, a risk assessment must be available to justify the reasons why.\nWhile complaint levels are a factor in making a decision on the necessity for a metal detector, this evidence alone will\nnot be sufficient justification for not using one. (For example, there may be instances of contamination which have not\nbeen reported by consumers.) Any justification for the absence of metal detection should be based on the nature of the\nproduct, the risk to the consumer, and alternative controls in place at the site which prevent metal contamination. Cost\nalone is not sufficient reason.\n\nIn all circumstances where products are manufactured to a customer’s specification, sites must comply with any customer\nrequirement for metal detection of their products. The decision tree in Figure 18 provides further guidance on the need\nfor metal detection equipment for products not packed into metallic containers. Where the product is packed into metal\npackaging, an effective alternative test method must be developed (e.g. X\n\n- ray or metal\n\n- detecting the product at the stage prior to packing, or the use of magnets and product inspection). Failsafes or alarms\nshould be implemented to notify production staff when failure of equipment is likely.

These tests should be completed with the line running under normal conditions, e.g. with correct\nline speeds to ensure consistency and accuracy under normal conditions\n\n- checking of the failsafe system, to ensure product is removed or held in a separate area (further information regarding\nfailsafe systems can be found in the interpretation for clause 4.10.3.4). The test piece should be passed through the X\n\n- ray equipment, ensuring that the least sensitive area is clearly identified, and this should be included in the\nprocedure. Depending on the design of the X\n\n- ray equipment, the least sensitive area of the detector may be located close to the X\n\n- ray source or the detector. Good practice is to test the system by using test pieces within a clearly identified sample\npack of the food being produced at the time of the test. Where in\n\n- line X\n\n- ray equipment is used, additional consideration will be needed to develop an effective test mechanism. For example, the\ntest piece must be placed in the product flow wherever possible, and the correct timings of the rejection system\nconfirmed, to ensure removal of the test piece. This must be completed at the start\n\n- up and end of production. Additional testing, where required, should be based on risk."

    "interpretation_guidance": "Magnets Some sectors of the food industry (e.g. grinding of cereals and production of coffee) employ magnets to reduce\nor remove metal fragments in the finished product. Where a magnet is used for these food safety purposes, it is\nimportant to document its type (e.g. electromagnet or permanent magnet), location and strength. Magnets are not an\nalternative to metal detectors, but an additional control mechanism, and factories using magnets must still comply with\nthe requirements of section 4.10.3. The magnet’s strength should be designed to ensure that it is sufficient to capture\nmetal foreign bodies. A number of factors should be considered when determining the correct strength; for example, the\ntype of product (e.g. the size of the food particles), the width of the conveyor belt, chute or other equipment in which\nthe magnets are located, and the flow rate of the food or raw material. Documented procedures must be in place to\nensure:\n\n- routine inspection (e.g. visual inspection for damage and the presence of captured metal fragments)\n\n- cleaning – the ability of a magnet to capture a foreign body can be hampered if dirt or other material is allowed to\ncollect on the magnet’s surface\n\n- strength testing (e.g. by using a magnetic meter (measuring the magnet’s strength in tesla) or through the use of a\nthird\n\n- party calibration service). Records of all checks, recalibrations or servicing must be maintained. Clause 4.10.1.3\nrequires sites to develop test procedures which consider:\n\n- the frequency of testing; for example, to ensure the site can take timely action on implicated product in the event of a\ntest failure\n\n- any specific customer requirements. Good practice for monitoring a magnet’s performance includes locating a second\n‘policing’ magnet as close to the first as possible. Any metal found on this second magnet indicates that the ‘process’\nmagnet is not performing satisfactorily and is failing to remove all metal particles."

    "interpretation_guidance": "Documented cleaning procedures Documented cleaning and disinfection procedures must be in place to ensure consistent and\neffective cleaning and as a guide for training purposes. When documenting such procedures, an emphasis should be placed\non the processing equipment and food contact surfaces. The procedures must be in sufficient detail for the cleaning to\nbe carried out to a consistently acceptable standard. In the majority of sites, good practice would normally include six\nstages of cleaning:\n\n- remove gross debris (e.g. sweep or wipe)\n\n- rinse with water\n\n- wash with detergent solution using hot water\n\n- rinse\n\n- dry\n\n- sanitise. Where equipment requires different levels of cleaning (e.g. between products, or between daily and weekly\ncleans), each requirement should be clearly detailed and specific to the item of equipment. These procedures need to be\nreviewed and updated whenever changes to the equipment and areas to be cleaned occur. In addition, a good cleaning\ninstruction would include:\n\n- a unique method of reference that can be quoted on paperwork (e.g. cleaning records)\n\n- photographs of equipment, which are useful for identifying equipment and for highlighting areas that are difficult to\nclean, or that form key check/verification points\n\n- the appropriate protective clothing or equipment that should be worn when cleaning or handling cleaning chemicals.\n\nClause Requirements Further guidance Developing an effective cleaning procedure In order for cleaning to be effective,\nit is important that the procedures are designed for the specific item, area or site. A generic, off\n\n- the\n\n- shelf procedure probably would not guarantee a sufficient standard of cleaning. For example, an identical work surface\nin an area handling bakery products would need to be treated differently from one in a meat\n\n- handling area. This would need to be assessed during the development and risk assessment stage. The complexity of the\nprocess and equipment, the types of product manufactured, the ease with which debris can be removed, and the need to\nmanage specific hazards (e.g. specific micro\n\n- organisms or allergens) are also factors to consider. Developing a cleaning procedure can be done in a few simple steps:\n\n- Step 1 Set the required standard of cleaning (clause 4.11.3) Consider legislation, customer requirements, industry or\ncategory best practice, etc. The risk assessment should consider the prevention of contamination from previous products,\nas well as address potential microbiological, chemical or allergen concerns.\n\n- Step 2 Develop draft procedures (clause 4.11.2) Ensure all items, areas and equipment are defined and included within\nthe procedures. Think about the order of cleaning too, so that cleaned equipment is not re\n\n- contaminated by subsequent cleaning activity.\n\n- Step 3 Validate the draft procedures (clause 4.11.3) Use validation to confirm that the required standard of cleaning\n(Step 1) is met. The Standard requires that cleaning procedures which form part of a defined prerequisite (i.e.\nprocedures that are used to control a specific hazard such as allergen cross\n\n- contamination) must be validated to ensure they are effective and deliver the intended level of cleaning. However, it is\nalso good practice for all cleaning procedures to be validated.\n\n- Step 4 Finalise procedures and associated documentation (e.g. cleaning records and sign\n\n- off) Keep records that show what type of cleaning was completed, when it was completed, who did it, and who checked the\ncleaning and signed it off as acceptable (a requirement of clause 4.11.2).\n\n- Step 5 Train relevant staff (clause 4.11.4).\n\n- Step 6 Complete ongoing monitoring and verification (clauses 4.11.2 and 4.11.5). When developing cleaning procedures, it\nis often useful to remember:\n\n- All equipment and areas must be included.\n\n- Cleaning needs should be discussed with equipment and chemical suppliers, who can often provide valuable assistance in\nidentifying suitable cleaning materials.\n\n- Validation and verification are needed for cleaning activities – validation before introducing the new procedure, and\nverification on an ongoing basis. Verification is the application of checks or tests, at regular intervals, to ensure\nthe cleaning procedure is still working and continues to deliver the required level of cleaning. Verification of\ncleaning may include internal audits, record reviews, swabs or tests of the cleaned equipment, and the assessment of\nstaff to ensure they have a clear understanding of the cleaning procedure.\n\nFurther guidance continued\n\n- Cleaning procedures should be reviewed whenever there are changes to the area, equipment or processes, including the\nintroduction of new products or the use of new ingredients. Example of a cleaning record In addition to cleaning\nprocedures, the Standard also requires records of the cleaning completed. As shown in Figure 19, records for routine\ncleaning generally include:\n\n- what was cleaned\n\n- who completed the cleaning\n\n- when the cleaning was completed\n\n- monitoring, sign\n\n- off or confirmation that appropriate cleaning has been completed to a satisfactory standard.

However, where the level of cleaning\nis to ensure a sterile food contact surface to make sure that all traces of an allergen have been removed or to prevent\ncross\n\n- contamination of different meat species, the level of acceptable cleaning performance may need to be based on more\nrigorous checks such as the results of ATP, microbiological or allergen tests. Where the cleaning procedure forms part\nof a defined prerequisite (section 2.2) designed to manage a specific hazard (e.g. allergen cross\n\n- contamination), then the procedure must be validated to confirm that the specified cleaning method, chemicals and\nconcentrations are capable of consistently achieving the level of performance required. Records of validation must be\nmaintained. When designing and validating cleaning procedures, cleaning chemical residues must be considered so that\nthey cannot become a source of product contamination (e.g. manufacturer’s instructions must be followed regarding rinse\nmethods). Cleaning checks should include hard\n\n- to\n\n- reach locations as well as surfaces and those locations that are easy to reach, effectively confirming satisfactory\ncleaning of all surfaces and areas. Where results are outside of the acceptable limits, the site’s procedures should\nensure that corrective action is taken (e.g. by repeating the cleaning process and rechecking the standard of cleaning).\nThe exact action will depend on the type of cleaning, the check methodology and the acceptable levels that have been\ndefined."

See clause\n8.5.4 for the specific requirements for CIP systems operating in multiple production risk zones (e.g. high\n\n- risk and high\n\n- care areas). Confirmation of the correct design and set\n\n- up may be achieved by an inspection report (e.g. from the equipment manufacturer) or by separate documented validation.\nA schematic plan or diagram should be provided by the supplier when the system is installed and must be updated whenever\na change is made, including to software, equipment and operation of the system.\n\nInterpretation continued Issues are most likely to occur where CIP systems are modified or extended. Therefore, controls\nmust be in place to ensure that all changes (e.g. engineering modifications, changes to the programming or operation of\nthe system, and changes to consumables such as the detergents used) are made only by a suitably trained and competent\nindividual. This could be achieved by, for example:\n\n- having a company policy that permits modifications only by the manufacturer of the equipment\n\n- training engineering staff\n\n- password\n\n- protecting the system with different levels of access to prevent unauthorised modifications to programme parameters or\nsoftware. Records of changes must be maintained. The site should use risk assessment to determine suitable intervals for\nrevalidation of the CIP system to ensure its continuing effectiveness. The CIP system will also require revalidation\nfollowing any alterations or additions to ensure it continues to operate as expected."

    "interpretation_guidance": "The aim of the environmental monitoring programme is to develop a proactive, preventive monitoring programme that will\nidentify and eliminate sources of environmental micro\n\n- organisms (e.g. pathogens and spoilage organisms) in production and open product areas of the site, and facilitate\ntimely and effective corrective action in the event of a risk being identified (i.e. prevent the environmental micro\n\n- organisms from becoming the source of product contamination which could lead to non\n\n- conforming product, a customer complaint or other incidents). An effective programme can, for example, be used to:\n\n- confirm the effectiveness of cleaning and hygiene activities and identify any areas that require further activity\n\n- prevent product contamination by acting as an ‘early warning’ – identifying potential contamination from the site\nfacilities before they affect products. The design and structure of this programme will depend on the nature of the\nproducts being handled and the potential hazards associated with them. The requirements are expected to apply to all\nsites with:\n\n- open product areas\n\n- ready\n\n- to\n\n- eat products\n\n- products that are both processed in open product areas and ready\n\n- to\n\n- eat. Sites are not expected to ‘opt out’ of this requirement by determining that they have a low\n\n- risk product or environment; completion of a risk assessment (clause 4.11.8.1) should only be used to identify relevant\nhazards, suitable monitoring techniques and appropriate monitoring frequencies. There are, however, a small number of\nproducts which are inherently safe from these contaminants (e.g. because the product’s intrinsic properties do not\nsupport the growth or survival of pathogens or spoilage organisms) and there is no opportunity for spoilage/pathogen\ncontamination, and therefore an environmental monitoring programme may not be required. Where a site believes that this\nis not required, this belief must have a strong foundation in science and not be used to prevent good practices.\nTherefore it is expected that:\n\n- all sites with high\n\n- risk, high\n\n- care or ambient high\n\n- care operations will have an environmental monitoring programme within the relevant open product areas\n\n- environmental monitoring will be applicable to other products, as there have been a number of very high\n\n- profile food poisoning outbreaks associated with products not conventionally considered as high risk or high care (for\nexample, cantaloupe melons, peanut butter, chocolate and milk powder), where environmental monitoring may have been\neffective in identifying an issue early. Similarly, shelf\n\n- life issues such as mould contamination of bakery products may be reduced by suitable monitoring. Where a site believes\nenvironmental monitoring is not required due to the absence of risk from pathogens and spoilage organisms, the site must\nprove this absence of risk. As a minimum, the site will have a robust risk assessment which considers:\n\n- both spoilage organisms and pathogens\n\n- the complete product range at the site.\n\nNote that this risk assessment must be more than a history of product testing – it must demonstrate an absence of risk.\nSuitable techniques include pathogen modelling, challenge testing and published literature from a reputable source\ndemonstrating that pathogens cannot survive or grow. Examples of products where risk assessment may establish that\nenvironmental monitoring is not required include:\n\n- alcoholic beverages and vinegars with a sufficiently high level of alcohol or acid to prevent survival and growth\n\n- salt and sugar in their dry ‘pure’ form\n\n- edible oils with no added ingredients\n\n- fully enclosed production. For example, at a specialist HPP (high\n\n- pressure processing) facility, where product is received packed, is processed in its packaging and leaves the site in\nthe same packaging\n\n- whole vegetables, sold unwashed. Auditors will challenge the basis of any risk assessment to make sure this has properly\nconsidered likely issues and is demonstrably based on robust science. The requirements for environmental monitoring\nindicate that the site’s environmental monitoring programme must be risk\n\n- based, therefore the food safety plan/HACCP may indicate risks that should be monitored. Risks may include pathogens\nand/or spoilage organisms (such as yeasts or moulds), and the site should consider whether it is more suitable to\nmonitor the risk directly or via indicator organisms. Well\n\n- known examples of pathogens and spoilage organisms that may be applicable to a site’s environmental monitoring include:\n\n- Listeria monocytogenes in ready\n\n- to\n\n- eat products, including those which are chilled and frozen. Alternatively, some sites monitor Listeria spp. and only\nexamine the species if adverse positive results are obtained\n\n- Salmonella and/or Enterobacteriaceae in dry environments where susceptible products are handled\n\n- yeasts and/or moulds: these are widespread spoilage organisms which may be of greater relevance for some product types.\nFor example, products such as jam are heated to a temperature that will kill many bacterial contaminants, are hot\n\n- filled, and have a low water activity and low oxygen content. Consequently, the risk of pathogen growth is limited.\nHowever, there are yeasts and moulds that can cause spoilage in these conditions, and therefore manufacturers must\nensure that packaging, food contact surfaces and the environment are monitored to minimise the risk of contamination.\nClause Requirements"

To\nachieve a similar level of control, manual temperature checks should be carried out on a 4\n\n- hourly basis, including during nights and weekends.

All allergens present on site must be considered so that procedures can be designed to prevent allergen cross\n\n- contact with each specific allergen. For example, contaminating an allergen\n\n- containing product with another allergen\n\n- containing product (such as contaminating a nut\n\n- containing product with a milk\n\n- containing product) is just as significant as contaminating a product with no allergens with that allergen. Effective\nallergen management procedures must be implemented even where on\n\n- pack warning labels (clause 5.3.6) are used. Particular attention should be given to:\n\n- physical segregation. Ideally, allergenic ingredients and products will be totally segregated from non\n\n- allergenic ingredients and products. This could involve, for example, dedicated storage areas, dedicated (and colour\n\n- coded) production equipment, and the use of dedicated production lines\n\n- time segregation. Where products must be handled in the same factory areas or on the same production lines,\nconsideration should be given to the use of time segregation. For example, all non\n\n- allergenic products could be produced first and allergenic materials introduced subsequently, or the use of allergenic\nmaterials could be confined to the end of a day/shift and only before a full clean. Production scheduling could also be\nused to minimise the frequency of changeovers between allergen\n\n- containing and non\n\n- allergen\n\n- containing products. For example, in some factories it is possible to limit the use of nuts to a defined period or\nshift, rather than producing nut\n\n- containing products throughout the week\n\n- the potential for protective clothing to be a source of allergen contamination. The use of separate clothing or overalls\nfor handling allergenic materials should be considered. It is normally useful to colour\n\n- code protective clothing to prevent confusion\n\n- the use of dedicated equipment or utensils. These should be clearly identifiable (e.g. by colour\n\n- coding)\n\n- allergens that can form fine powders (e.g. flour, milk powder and soya isolates). The movement of airborne dust should\nbe minimised by, for example, using physical barriers (such as shrouds, lids or segregated areas) for dispensing and\nmixing operations. The location of air\n\n- conditioning outlets or the use of fans should also be considered to ensure these do not distribute airborne allergens\n\n- waste handling and spillage controls. Allergens should be removed efficiently, ensuring that the removal process does\nnot become the source of allergen contamination in other areas of the factory\n\n- the allergens that may be handled in non\n\n- production areas of the site (e.g. in canteens or in new product development). A policy for food brought on site by\nstaff, or used in vending machines or catering facilities, should be developed. The policy may ban certain allergens or\nrestrict them to certain areas of the site. Where colour\n\n- coding is used, consideration must be given to the choice of colours to ensure that colour\n\n- blind staff are able to identify the correct items."

A number of best\n\n- practice guidelines have been published on the validation of cleaning (e.g. Campden BRI Guideline 59 – Validation of\nCleaning to Remove Food Allergens). The cleaning procedures must be routinely verified by, for example:\n\n- visual inspections and documented sign\n\n- off\n\n- inclusion in internal audits\n\n- the use of swabs or testing (e.g. rapid tests, ATP, lateral flow devices or laboratory tests).

    "interpretation_guidance": "Vulnerability assessment A vulnerability assessment is a search for potential weaknesses in the supply chain in order to\nprevent food fraud (i.e. to prevent the adulteration or substitution of raw materials before they arrive at the site).\nIt is a specialised form of risk assessment, and needs a systematic and structured approach to ensure data gathering,\nidentification of significant food fraud hazards, assessment of likelihood of occurrence, and identification and\nimplementation of controls to mitigate genuine risks. The aim of the assessment is not to assess the potential for fraud\nat the site, but to examine the supply chain for potential concerns or weaknesses, thereby identifying those raw\nmaterials that are at particular risk of adulteration or substitution, so that appropriate controls can be put in place\n(clause 5.4.4). The vulnerability assessment will consider information relating to each ingredient in order to assess\nwhether there is a potential for food fraud. Where a site purchases a number of similar raw materials, it may be\npossible to consider these as a group rather than each raw material individually, providing the risks are similar. The\ncompany will need to ensure that all food materials are subject to a vulnerability assessment. Typical information to\nincorporate into the assessment includes:\n\n- any emerging issues and information identified in clause 5.4.2\n\n- historical evidence of substitution or adulteration of the ingredient\n\n- cost/value of the material\n\n- availability (e.g. a poor harvest may restrict availability and may increase the potential for adulteration)\n\n- sophistication of routine testing to identify adulterants. If testing within the supply chain is comprehensive and\nspecifically focused on potential fraud issues, then the likelihood of adulteration is reduced (e.g. fruit juice is\noften tested for a comprehensive range of parameters, including DNA, isotopic analysis, added sugars and added water to\nprevent potential fraud)\n\nInterpretation continued\n\n- country of origin\n\n- length and complexity of the supply chain\n\n- supply chain model\n\n- controls that are already in the supply chain. For example, if the raw material supplier is certificated to the\nStandard, then as part of that certification the supplier must have completed its own vulnerability assessment, and\nthere is no requirement in the Standard for the site to duplicate its supplier’s vulnerability assessment. The nature of\nthe raw material may change the potential for food fraud. For example, if a slaughterhouse is purchasing cattle, horses\nand pigs for slaughter, it will be obvious if there is an issue with the live animals; however, if the slaughterhouse\nintends to make a claim such as organic, Aberdeen Angus or specified country of origin, then greater controls of raw\nmaterials will be required to ensure only those which meet the claim are purchased. Similarly, prepared ingredients such\nas beef mince or ground spices are likely to have a greater risk than the whole ingredient. The Standard does not define\nthe exact process that the site must follow when completing the vulnerability assessment; however, it is likely to\nincorporate the following steps:\n\n- draw up a list of raw materials (or groups of raw materials) and the controls (e.g. product testing, traceability\nsystems or supply chain audits) that are already in operation\n\n- consider the information obtained from clause 5.4.2 for each ingredient\n\n- complete a risk assessment on the vulnerability of each ingredient. Note that the Standard does not require full supply\nchain mapping for all raw materials, although this may be a useful tool where a risk assessment indicates that a genuine\nrisk exists and there is a need to identify the point in the supply chain where an effective control can be applied. The\noutput of the vulnerability assessment must include a documented vulnerability assessment plan which should rank or\nscore the materials to identify those which need additional controls. The ranking and actions required could, for\nexample, be as follows:\n\n- Very high A high\n\n- profile raw material with recent reports of adulteration published by regulatory authorities. Action or monitoring is\nrequired to ensure only genuine materials are purchased\n\n- High A high\n\n- profile material that provides an attractive target for potential adulteration. Some action and/or monitoring is\nrequired to ensure only genuine materials are purchased\n\n- Low This material is unlikely to be a target for substitution or adulteration; however a re\n\n- assessment may be necessary if new information becomes available\n\n- Negligible No further action required as the material is extremely unlikely to be a target for food fraud. As mentioned\nearlier in this interpretation, situations relating to food fraud change, and it is therefore important that the company\nhas a dynamic system that can react to and assess new information as it becomes available, thereby ensuring the\nvulnerability assessment remains up to date. At a minimum, the vulnerability assessment must be reviewed at least\nannually and when there is a significant change to the ingredient. As a guide, a review may be triggered by the\nfollowing, although this is not an exhaustive list:\n\n- a change in the country of origin or the supplier of raw materials\n\n- a change in the financial situation of raw material suppliers or countries of origin\n\n- a change in cost of raw materials, either upwards or downwards\n\n- a change in the supply chain, logistics and delivery of materials\n\n- a change in material availability (e.g. because of seasonal shortages)\n\n- emergence of a new risk (e.g. known adulteration of an ingredient)\n\n- developments in scientific information associated with ingredients, process or product\n\n- information received as part of a supplier approval or raw material risk assessment (e.g. clause 3.5.1.1) which\nhighlights new or evolving risks. A number of risk assessment tools have been published. These include some specialist\nvulnerability assessment tools such as CARVER + Shock and TACCP (threat assessment and critical control points), which\nmay be used to achieve a structured approach to the assessment process. BRCGS has published a number of items to assist\nwith vulnerability assessments. These include a specific vulnerability assessment guideline that can be obtained from\nthe BRCGS Store or viewed online at BRCGS Participate, and a training course available through BRCGS Performance\nEnhancement and its global network of approved training providers. A number of organisations have produced tools to\nassist with food fraud and vulnerability assessments, including, for example, the Food Fraud Resilience Self\n\n- Assessment Tool available on the UK FSA website."

Such a claim may be made either on the\nproduct label for the consumer or in business\n\n- to\n\n- business communication. The types of claim include:\n\n- varietal claims (e.g. basmati rice, Aberdeen Angus beef, Bramley apples and cod fish cakes)\n\n- origin claims (e.g. Madagascan vanilla and Florida grapefruit)\n\n- assurance claims (e.g. GLOBALG.A.P., Red Tractor, Marine Stewardship, dolphin\n\n- friendly tuna and sustainable palm oil)\n\n- identity\n\n- preserved claims (e.g. GMO\n\n- free). Claims which relate to the composition of the product (e.g. nutritional claims, fat\n\n- free, reduced sugar, free\n\n- from) are covered in clauses 5.3.7 and 5.4.7. It is the responsibility of the site to make reasonable checks to ensure\nthat the raw materials supplied are genuine and that claims made about ingredients are proven. For many assurance\nschemes, such as GLOBALG.A.P., it is possible to check the assurance status and the scope of products of the supplier on\na database. Reliance solely on a declaration from a supplier will not be sufficient. Where claims relate to variety or\nspecies (e.g. varieties of fruit), examination of visual characteristics may suffice. However, for claims where visual\nanalysis is not possible (e.g. block frozen fish), certificates of analysis and periodic sample analysis will be\nrequired. Full traceability records must be maintained, as required in section 3.9. The records must also include\ndetails of the quantities purchased and amounts used at each step to enable a mass balance exercise to be undertaken. In\nthe absence of more frequent requirements relating to a particular scheme, the site must undertake a mass balance\ntraceability exercise on typical products for which a claim is made at least every 6 months. This must ensure that the\nsystem of records maintained enables all finished product batches to be identified for a particular batch of raw\nmaterials and that, for a given finished product, the batch(es) of raw materials used for its production can be\nidentified. The test must be carried out in both directions.\n\nThe ingredients selected for the mass balance exercise must include the ingredient for which a claim is made. The\nobjective is to test the systems and, where necessary, make improvements to information recording to allow claims to be\nsubstantiated should they be challenged by a customer or legal authority. It follows that, where very different\ntraceability systems are used within, for example, a complex or multi\n\n- product site, more than one mass balance traceability exercise may be required every 6 months to ensure that all systems\nare working effectively. However, where a site has multiple claims, it is not intended that every claim be mass balance\ntested every 6 months but that a representative selection of claims are chosen. In this situation, good practice would\nbe to choose different claims or products each time the test is conducted. The use of a third\n\n- party mass balance exercise (e.g. by an organic certifier or by the Fairtrade Foundation) would be acceptable evidence\nof a test, providing that records of the test, the results and evidence of any necessary improvements made as a result\nof the test are maintained. Where the third\n\n- party scheme measures the mass balance over a period (e.g. 1 month) rather than for a single batch code this is\nconsidered acceptable providing the requirements discussed above are met. If, as part of the requirements for a\nparticular scheme or to use a logo, there is a requirement for more frequent mass balance traceability exercises, then\nthat scheme’s requirements must be met."

For example, an on\n\n- pack claim that a product is plant\n\n- based or vegetarian would need to be validated, and this may include:\n\n- inclusion of the claim in raw material risk assessment, supplier approval and specifications\n\n- inclusion of the claim in the food safety plan, e.g. use of the process flow (see below) leading to specific controls\nsuch as segregation and dedicated equipment, or validated cleaning regimes\n\n- review of the production processes, equipment segregation etc. Good practice is to ensure that a programme of ongoing\nverification and monitoring is in place to demonstrate that claims are consistently met. Claims such as ‘free from\nallergen’ and ‘allergen\n\n- free’ need particular care to ensure that cross\n\n- contamination cannot occur during processing. This is covered separately in clause 5.3.7. The process flow diagram used\nwithin the food safety plan (or HACCP process) may be used as the basis for demonstrating compliance with this clause\n(the requirement may already be covered within the HACCP or food safety plan). The site must identify (e.g. as a list or\non the process flow) potential areas where mixing of products or loss of identity may occur. Procedures of working or\nchanges in process flow must be introduced to reduce the risk of mistakes and false claims being made.

    "interpretation_guidance": "Compliance with legislative requirements There have been incidences of product recalls which have resulted from a lack\nof communication between the supplier of the packaging materials and the food manufacturer, typically where a packaging\nmaterial has been used in extreme product conditions or where packaging not designed for direct food contact has been\nused (e.g. a plastic liner of a carton is removed or changed to reduce costs). The company must be able to demonstrate\nthat each item of product packaging meets legal requirements for its use (e.g. compliance with food contact regulations\nin the country of sale). This may be in the form of specifications, migration data or a certificate of conformity. Where\na declaration of conformity is used, any limitations on usage must be stated (e.g. the food types or storage conditions:\nambient, chilled or frozen). The supplier of the packaging must be made aware of the conditions under which the\npackaging is going to be used, so that the suitability of the packaging materials can be confirmed. This may take the\nform of a specification provided to the packaging supplier and would include, as appropriate:\n\n- contact with food – direct food contact or, where not used for direct food contact, the nature of the barrier layer\n\n- characteristics of the food – any adverse characteristics of the food which may increase migration of chemicals from the\npackaging (e.g. high fat content, or low or high product pH)\n\n- conditions of processing (e.g. high\n\n- temperature fill, thermal processing in pack, or freezing)\n\n- expected customer usage (e.g. microwave in pack, cooking in pack, or freezing)\n\n- use of recyclable or reusable packaging materials\n\n- other packaging, especially where the components will be supplied by different companies and there is a need for\ncompatibility between the component parts (e.g. a bottle and cap manufactured and supplied by different suppliers).\nDirect food contact materials are of most concern as these have the greatest potential for harm and many geographical\nregions have specific legislation around direct contact packaging. However, there may be risk associated with the\nadditional layers of packaging, particularly labelling which often comprises the primary pack (consumer unit) and also\nsecondary packaging such as corrugated cases. Physical or chemical contamination can occur from these packaging\ncomponents. Discussions with the provider of packaging materials are imperative to ensure that the right materials in\nthe right configurations are used (e.g. it may be necessary to use lower levels of recycled content in a corrugated case\nfor products that are susceptible to chemical migration). Extensive work at the start of the process is incredibly\nvaluable and can prevent costly errors from being made in specifications.\n\nInterpretation continued It is also vital to consider the product supply chain to establish the most appropriate\npackaging, given the storage and distribution conditions that the product will be subjected to. The requirement allows\nsome flexibility in the approach used; for example, a site could use risk assessment to identify the appropriate\ncontrols, and establish the level of evidence that is satisfactory for the level of risk (although the site would need\nto ensure that any legal requirements were addressed). For example, in the EU the site may decide that it needs to\nreview an EU Declaration of Compliance (DoC) for Food Contact Materials due to a perceived risk of migration. The site\nwould need to demonstrate that the evidence available is appropriate for the level of risk associated with the packaging\n– it would not be acceptable to list the clause as ‘not applicable’, as there should also be evidence that the matter\nhas been adequately communicated/discussed with the packaging supplier. BRCGS has published a guideline on migration\nfrom packaging materials into food, which may be purchased from the BRCGS Store or viewed online at BRCGS Participate."

Where test results are found to be outside established limits, there must be clear protocols on the\nactions to be taken (e.g. product hold, additional testing, customer notification, product withdrawal or recall).\nAppropriate actions should be implemented promptly to address unsatisfactory results or trends and thus protect consumer\nsafety, product quality, legality and brand reputation. Records of the results, review and any actions taken should be\nmaintained. The site must agree with the laboratory on how the measurement uncertainty shall be applied to results (for\nsome tests, in some countries, this may be defined by legislation). Measurement uncertainty Measurement uncertainty\n(sometimes simply referred to as ‘uncertainty’) is a parameter associated with the result of a quantitative measurement.\nIt is defined as the range of the values that could reasonably be expected for the attribute (e.g. the micro\n\n- organism, allergen or chemical) being measured. It is sometimes known as the ‘margin of doubt’ of the result.\nMeasurement uncertainty is important when making conformity decisions (i.e. assessing whether a test result is within\nlegal, safety or acceptable limits), as the range of probable values may cross one of these limits. No matter what\nmethod is used, it will be subject to challenges inherent in taking the measurements accurately, day\n\n- to\n\n- day variations (e.g. in equipment, reagents, personnel or environmental conditions), and any systematic errors, random\nerrors or corrections associated with the test; therefore the result obtained is the best estimate of the value. Random\nerrors are errors that fluctuate due to the unpredictability or uncertainty inherent in the measuring process, or the\nvariation in the quantity being measured (i.e. variation throughout the sample or product being tested, and this is\noften demonstrated by the normal variation seen in replicate measurements of the same material). A systematic error is\none that originates from a persistent issue and leads to a consistent error in the measurements; for example, recovery.\n\nMeasurement uncertainty continued Product testing is often completed to establish compliance with limits; i.e. to\ndemonstrate that a product meets the requirements defined in its specification, by regulations and by customers. Knowing\nthe measurement uncertainty is important when making these conformity decisions. For illustrative purposes only, in\nFigure 20, the horizontal line represents the target value or limit; values above this fall outside the permitted range,\nand values below it are within the permitted range. A B C D Figure 20 Example of the possible effects of measurement\nuncertainty Results A and D are well above or well below the limit, and thus applying the measurement uncertainty value\nwill not change the conformity statement made (e.g. A is still outside the limit and D is still in specification). It is\nin results B and C where measurement uncertainty would impact on the conformity. The value obtained for C is within the\nlimit. However, if the result and measurement uncertainty are combined, the value represented by C may fall above the\nlimit and thus be out of specification. The value obtained for B is above the limit and therefore would be out of\nspecification, but taking measurement uncertainty into consideration, there is a potential that B could fall below the\nthreshold (i.e. be within specification). Applying measurement uncertainty in this manner needs careful consideration\nand justification depending on the risk, applicable legislation or customer requirements. Where the test is of a\ncritical parameter (e.g. product safety or legality), measurement uncertainty must not be used to prevent taking the\ncorrect action to protect consumers and/or maintain legality."

If traceability\nis to the day or batch rather than to specific carcasses, in the event of a product withdrawal or recall, the whole day\nof production or batch may need to be recalled for each edible part. The site must document its traceability procedure,\nand ensure relevant personnel are trained in it and it is fully implemented. Note that for the purposes of this clause,\nedible parts include any part of the carcass which enters the human food chain (including offal, animal by\n\n- products for human food chain, and blood for human consumption; e.g. in the UK, blood is incorporated into the\nmanufacture of black pudding). The site should be aware that in addition to a documented procedure, traceability\nrequires a number of activities including identification of raw materials, intermediate/semi\n\n- processed products, part\n\n- used materials, and finished products in accordance with clause 3.9.2."

    "interpretation_guidance": "Critical safety or quality parameters The objective is to ensure that products can be consistently produced and stored\nwithin clearly defined parameters (e.g. within defined temperatures). It is recognised that process conditions are often\nnot uniform throughout a chill store or an oven. It is important,\n\ntherefore, to identify hot or cold spots, both to try to improve uniformity and to identify worst\n\n- case scenarios to ensure that all products meet at least the minimum process conditions. The Standard includes some\ncommon examples of equipment parameters such as:\n\n- heat distribution in retorts, ovens and processing vessels – the Standard expects heat\n\n- distribution studies to be carried out on cooking equipment wherever small variations in process temperature may affect\nthe safety of the products. Heat\n\n- distribution studies of a static oven may identify cold spots. If it is not possible to make adjustments to eliminate\nthese cold spots, the areas should be used as the worst\n\n- case scenarios when completing heat\n\n- distribution studies\n\n- temperature distribution in freezers and cold stores – when assessing whether to undertake temperature distribution\nstudies on chill or freezer facilities, the level of risk will depend on the product, the time spent in store and any\nmargin allowed by the temperature settings (e.g. setting the temperature at −20°C to ensure achievement of −18°C).\nTemperature distribution studies would not normally be necessary for small chill or cold stores where product is stored\nonly for short periods. However, this is not a prescriptive list, and the site should consider all situations where\nvariations in processing conditions may occur in equipment critical to the safety or quality of products. For example,\nif pH is identified as critical, it may be necessary to validate the pH distribution in a mixing vessel, and consider\nthe thoroughness of the mixing process to achieve the desired pH throughout the batch. When testing equipment, any\nseasonal variations in performance must be considered, especially when trying to assess worst\n\n- case scenarios. For example, a chiller evaluated in winter may not give the same results in summer, especially if there\nare large seasonal differences in the ambient temperatures. Some refrigeration equipment may be at the limit of their\nperformance on especially hot days if temperature parameters have not been properly specified."

Where multiple\ncomponent packaging is used (e.g. pots with separate lids, multi\n\n- packs or packaging with separate labels), then the controls will need to apply to all the individual parts, to ensure\nthey all match the product being produced. The integrity of date codes is vital to ensure product safety is maintained.\nWhere date codes (or other information) are applied to packaging or product on site (e.g. on the trays, sleeves or flow\nwraps), this must be controlled so that only authorised (and competent) personnel can set or make the changes to\nprinters (e.g. inputting the required date code).

Checks must be in place to monitor that actual label use matches\nexpected label use (i.e. the actual and expected uses are reconciled). The aim is to confirm correct usage, and\ntherefore provide an opportunity for any inconsistencies or unexpected results to be investigated. The Standard is not\nprescriptive on how this is completed; however, the site may find it useful to consider:\n\n- the typical waste tolerance, i.e. how many labels are typically wasted or destroyed during a production run (this allows\nnormal waste figures to be included in the reconciliation)\n\n- the number of labels received, issued, used or restocked, along with any obsolete, misprinted or destroyed labels that\nneed to be accounted for\n\n- systems for recording packing information; for example, when new reels or new batches of labels are added to the line\n\n- the frequency of the checks – for most sites, this is likely to be at the end of each production run, as this allows\ninvestigation of any inconsistences while the product is still within the site’s control.

However, where the verification equipment exists as a separate item of equipment (situated,\nfor example, towards the end of a production line, similar to the common placement of metal detectors), good practice is\nto test the system using incorrect packs to ensure that the equipment identifies and rejects those packs.

In these situations, the site may devise alternative\ntesting solutions.

    "interpretation_guidance": "Hand\n\n- washing Hand\n\n- washing must be conducted at a frequency appropriate to the level of risk to the product being produced and in line with\ngood industry practice. At a minimum, hands must be washed before staff enter the production area and whenever an\nactivity is undertaken that could potentially be a risk to products (e.g. after going to the toilet, eating, smoking,\nblowing noses, sneezing or handling shoes). Appropriate instructions for hand\n\n- washing, considering the language needs of staff (e.g. including pictorial instructions), must be provided (clause\n4.8.4).\n\nFurther guidance Introduction to hand\n\n- washing techniques Hand\n\n- washing is recognised as an effective way to reduce the risk of contaminating food with micro\n\n- organisms such as E. coli, Salmonella and Staphylococcus aureus. However, a number of studies have shown that people\neither do not wash their hands or fail to clean them effectively. So it is vital that food companies not only provide\nstaff with appropriate facilities to wash their hands but also ensure staff are aware of the correct procedure to\nfollow. What makes a good hand\n\n- washing procedure? Frequency Hand\n\n- washing should be carried out as often as is appropriate for the level of risk to the product. At a minimum hands should\nbe washed:\n\n- before entering production areas\n\n- after any break which involves leaving the production area\n\n- after going to the toilet\n\n- after eating or smoking\n\n- after blowing your nose. See also clause 8.4.1 for hand\n\n- washing facilities and procedures in high\n\n- risk and high\n\n- care zones. Method There are a number of steps in an effective hand\n\n- washing procedure:\n\n- wet hands with water\n\n- apply soap\n\n- rub the hands so that all the parts of the hands are cleaned, including palms, backs of hands, between fingers, backs of\nfingers, thumbs and fingertips\n\n- rinse hands to remove soap\n\n- dry hands thoroughly, as careful drying is a vital step in preventing the contamination of food products. For a\npictorial example of best practice for hand\n\n- washing, visit the World Health Organization’s ‘How to Handwash?’ page. In addition to the above routine, good practice\nis to apply a sanitiser such as an anti\n\n- bacterial hand gel after the hands have been washed and dried. An effective hand\n\n- washing routine should take approximately 40–60 seconds to complete. Training It is important that a good hygiene\nculture operates within the site so that an effective hand\n\n- washing routine becomes normal, everyday behaviour. This means that all new staff should be trained (e.g. during\ninduction training) in the site’s hand\n\n- cleaning procedures and understand the importance of them. Regular updates can help ensure the information remains fresh\nin people’s minds. Facilities For a description of hand\n\n- washing facilities, see the guidance for clause 4.8.4.\n\nClause Requirements"

The monitoring of the effectiveness of cleaning is likely to consist of visual\nassessment and the monitoring of complaints. In\n\n- house laundering carried out on the company premises must be controlled. This is likely to be via HACCP\n\n- style principles, controls and validation data, such as monitoring of the temperature and detergent, specifying items\nnot to be washed together, overseeing drying processes and visual inspection. The laundry will also be included in the\nprogramme of internal audits (clause 3.4.1). Laundries (both in\n\n- house and contracted) must ensure that:\n\n- dirty and clean clothing is adequately segregated to ensure that recently laundered items are not re\n\n- contaminated\n\nInterpretation continued\n\n- the protective clothing is effectively cleaned (e.g. by the completion of microbiological validation and verification\ntests)\n\n- cleaned clothes are protected from contamination until delivered to the site (e.g. through the use of covers or bags).\nThe Standard allows home laundering of protective clothing by employees, but only in exceptional circumstances, where\nboth of the following conditions are met:\n\n- protective clothing is not used for product safety purposes, but is instead used to protect the employee from the\nproducts handled; for example, in the produce industry, raw vegetables arriving from the fields may be covered in mud or\ndirt, and employees wear overalls to protect their personal clothing and\n\n- it is used only in low\n\n- risk or enclosed product areas (these are both defined in Appendix 2 of the Standard). It is important that where a site\nwishes to approve home laundering, both of these requirements are satisfied. For example, home laundering would not be\npermitted in bakeries because although the protective clothing is being used in a low\n\n- risk area, it is an open product area where the clothing is needed to protect the product, not the employee. Home\nlaundering still requires appropriate care and attention to ensure that potential pathogens are removed or killed.\nTherefore, where approved, home laundering needs to be controlled by written instructions, including, for example:\n\n- how garments are to be washed (temperature, detergent, specifying items not to be washed together, and drying\ninstructions such as the use of a hot iron to further heat\n\n- disinfect the clothes)\n\n- procedures for transporting clean protective clothing to the workplace; for example, provision of sealable plastic bags\nor similar, which allow washed garments to be transported from home to the workplace without becoming contaminated\n\n- on\n\n- site procedures; for example, defined responsibility within the company for monitoring the effectiveness of the system\n(typically achieved by visual inspection). There must also be a procedure and system for effectively dealing with any\ncase where employees are unable to perform self\n\n- laundry, either through lack of diligence or through lack of facilities. This system must be capable of being brought\ninto immediate effect once a problem has been identified."

The site shall be able to demonstrate that production facilities and controls are suitable\nto prevent pathogen contamination of products. Interpretation Prevention of potential contamination with pathogens is of\nparamount importance in the production of safe food. One of the key ways of achieving this is to ensure the correct\ndesign (e.g. segregation) and control (e.g. restricted access) of areas of the site where open products, susceptible to\ncontamination, are handled. The Standard defines these areas as production risk zones. The main principle of the\nproduction risk zones in the Standard is to ensure that the environmental conditions and controls in open product areas\nare appropriate for the products being handled. Therefore the expectations for factory hygiene, finish of buildings,\nequipment, protective clothing and staff hygiene should reflect the potential risks to the product. Where a site\nproduces products that require handling in high\n\n- risk, high\n\n- care and/or ambient high\n\n- care production facilities (see Appendix 2 of the Standard for the definition of products that require these\nfacilities), equivalent controls are expected for any subsequent handling or re\n\n- packing operation where the product is open to the factory environment (i.e. the re\n\n- packing site is expected to have equivalent facilities). BRCGS has produced a specific guideline on high risk, high care\nand ambient high care, which explains the requirements and provides details of good practice. It may be purchased from\nthe BRCGS Store or viewed online at BRCGS Participate."

    "interpretation_guidance": "High\n\n- risk areas High\n\n- risk areas require the highest levels of hygiene, working practices, and design and fabrication of facilities and\nequipment, to prevent product contamination from microbiological hazards. High\n\n- risk areas must be fully separated areas, with physical segregation in place between them and other parts of the\nfacility. The purpose of the physical segregation is to provide a self\n\n- contained area where uncovered (i.e. unprotected) high\n\n- risk products are handled after the microbiological kill step (e.g. heat treatment or cooking) until they are fully\nprotected, usually by means of final packaging. The segregating barrier must be capable of minimising the risk of cross\n\n- contamination from:\n\n- pathogens which may be present in a low\n\n- risk environment or on products or ingredients that have not received a full cook\n\n- all people moving between the high\n\n- risk area and other areas, except through designated changing areas\n\n- the movement of all equipment, cleaning chemicals, utensils or materials into the high\n\n- risk area, except through designated ports with sanitising controls in place\n\n- water or other liquids (e.g. cleaning chemicals) on the floor, washing into the high\n\n- risk area\n\n- airborne contaminants (e.g. dust particles or water droplets).\n\nInterpretation continued The ideal barrier is a full wall (e.g. a separate room) separating the high\n\n- risk area from other areas. In assessing the suitability of a segregating barrier, a risk assessment should be carried\nout and documented. Time segregation is not an acceptable alternative for high\n\n- risk areas, except for the transfer areas noted below. The location and operation of all transfer points must not\ncompromise high\n\n- risk and low\n\n- risk segregation. For example, where raw materials or staff move into a high\n\n- risk area, consideration must be given to whether this introduces a contamination hazard; it may therefore require\nmeasures that involve:\n\n- use of disinfection\n\n- removal of outer packaging\n\n- double\n\n- door ovens, blast chillers or freezers (i.e. those with a separate entrance and exit)\n\n- controlled air flow (clause 8.2.2)\n\n- changing the design of entrances and exits (e.g. roller lifting doors may represent a risk when raised, due to the fact\nthey have been in contact with the floor and the difficulty in cleaning them effectively). High\n\n- risk areas are expected to be self\n\n- contained and fully segregated. Best practice is that, where there is a cook step in the production of high\n\n- risk products, the cooker becomes the transfer point into the high\n\n- risk area via a double\n\n- door system (i.e. the cooker is loaded in the low\n\n- risk area and unloaded directly into the high\n\n- risk area). While new cooker installations and new\n\n- build sites must incorporate double\n\n- door cooking systems, many existing plants are equipped with single\n\n- door cookers and have established risk\n\n- based procedures for the loading and unloading of the cookers to prevent cross\n\n- contamination of cooked products. The Standard will, therefore, accept the use of single\n\n- door cooking systems where a thorough risk assessment has been completed as an interim measure prior to the eventual\nupgrading. Operating practices must be consistently achievable and effective, and prevent cross\n\n- contamination of cooked products. The risk assessment must consider, and control potential risk, from:\n\n- crossover between cooked and raw products in the unloading area\n\n- operators and their clothing (e.g. handling of cooked products by operators who have previously worked with raw\nproducts)\n\n- hand\n\n- contamination resulting from touching surfaces such as common equipment, cooker control panels and cooker door handles\n\n- equipment used for transferring product into and out of cookers\n\n- airborne contamination from low\n\n- risk processes (e.g. the loading and unloading area should be separate from the main low\n\n- risk processing area)\n\n- the floor (e.g. contamination of the wheels of trolleys transferring cooked products to the high\n\n- risk area). When cooked products are unloaded from the cooker, they must be moved immediately to a designated high\n\n- risk area to meet the requirements of the Standard. The auditor will assess the procedures in operation where single\n\n- door cookers are in use to ensure they are adequate, effective and understood by operators. The audit report will\ndescribe the procedures in place to protect the cooked products from contamination. High\n\n- risk areas contain only components and foods which have undergone a cook or similar process to achieve, typically, a 6\n\n- log reduction for Listeria. Where a single area includes, by necessity, some components which have received a lesser\nkill, together with fully cooked components (e.g. in a sandwich preparation area), this will be classed as high care.\n\nClause Requirements Example Cooked crustacea – a product requiring a high\n\n- risk production zone Where crustacea are cooked as part of the production process, or were cooked at an earlier step in\nthe production process (including at another site), the site will need to ensure the correct production risk zones are\nused. According to the definitions in Appendix 2 of the Standard, cooked crustacea fit into the definition of a product\nrequiring a high\n\n- risk production zone because:\n\n- finished product is chilled or frozen to preserve food safety\n\n- all components have received a full cook (equivalent to a 6 log reduction in Listeria monocytogenes)\n\n- finished product is vulnerable to growth of pathogens or survival of pathogens that could subsequently grow during\nnormal storage and use\n\n- finished product is ready to eat or ready to heat or, on the basis of known consumer use, is likely to be eaten without\nadequate cooking. Although the Standard recognises that some food products can be effectively managed using consumer\ncooking instructions, these instructions are not considered a valid justification for using a different production zone\nfor cooked crustacea, as known consumer use in many countries is to eat the product cold without any heating, and\ntherefore without a full cook by the consumer. Furthermore, the product appearance could lead consumers to believe the\nproduct is already fully cooked, and that no additional cooking is required. Where a site is partially heating a\ncrustacean (i.e. less than a 6\n\n- log reduction in Listeria monocytogenes), a high\n\n- care area will be appropriate."

Vulnerable products and ingredients have, before entry to the high\n\n- care area, undergone a process to reduce any contamination by pathogenic bacteria (e.g. a chlorine wash of salad\nmaterials, or an early cook step as in the pasteurisation of cream). It is important that the high\n\n- care area is effectively protected from contamination by low\n\n- risk zones. This is most effectively achieved through full physical segregation by means of walls which separate the\nhigh\n\n- care area from other factory areas. Where a separate, fully walled\n\n- off area is not available, alternative procedures must be in place to segregate the high\n\n- care area. The segregating barrier must be capable of preventing the risk of cross\n\n- contamination from:\n\nInterpretation continued\n\n- unauthorised access and movement between high\n\n- care and other areas of the factory, except through designated changing areas\n\n- transfer of materials, cleaning chemicals, utensils or equipment, except through designated ports with sanitising\ncontrols in place\n\n- microbiological contamination which may be present in a low\n\n- risk environment\n\n- airborne contaminants (e.g. dust particles or water droplets). The segregating barrier may include time or space\nseparation, control of movement or other restrictions. In assessing its suitability, a risk assessment must be carried\nout and documented. The method employed must be validated to demonstrate that the controls are effective in preventing\ncross\n\n- contamination. The auditor will critically examine the arrangements to ensure that potential risks for contamination\nhave been addressed, and that the alternative controls are consistently workable before the solution is considered\nacceptable. (This will be recorded in the audit report.) Where the solution is time segregation (i.e. a time separation\nbetween low\n\n- risk and high\n\n- care products being produced in the same area, to allow the area to be converted from a low\n\n- risk zone to a high\n\n- care zone (e.g. by cleaning, changes of protective clothing, or environmental monitoring)):\n\n- The changeover between low\n\n- risk and high\n\n- care operations should be as infrequent as possible, as it is unlikely that a sufficient standard of cleaning could be\nreached if changes occur frequently during the day.\n\n- Fully validated procedures to change the area from low risk to high care are required. These activities need to be taken\ninto account when scheduling production, to ensure effective transformation of the area, including personnel. If the\nsame personnel are responsible for the area during low\n\n- risk and high\n\n- care operations, they must undergo a complete change of protective clothing.\n\n- The shared area must be designed to meet the requirements of the high\n\n- care zone. Therefore all the facilities must be appropriate for a high\n\n- care production zone; for example, drainage is appropriate and meets the requirements of clause 8.2.1. Where product\ncharacteristics meet the description of high care but the systems are fully enclosed (e.g. dairies filling cartons with\nmilk), the production area is considered an enclosed product area. However, additional precautions are required when\nbreaking into the lines or entering filler equipment (e.g. for maintenance, to free product blockage or for cleaning).\nWherever equipment is entered, the necessary hygiene requirements must be completed before operations can recommence. It\nis expected that newly built factories will employ full wall segregation where high\n\n- care facilities are required.\n\nClause Requirements"

Where products fall into the ambient high care category, the site should conduct a risk\nassessment to identify the potential risks of cross\n\n- contamination (e.g. locations where cross\n\n- contamination could occur) and introduce procedures and processes to manage these potential risks.

If\nmembers of the cleaning team (or indeed anyone else, such as engineers or visitors) enter an area while production is in\nprogress or open products are present, they must follow the same clothing rules as production staff. If cleaning occurs\noutside production time, the absolute rules on protective clothing may be adapted but must ensure that the production\narea is left in a condition, after cleaning, such that no microbiological risks have been introduced by the cleaners or\nthe equipment used. The same principles apply to engineers undertaking maintenance work (which should be followed by\ncleaning to restore the microbiological security of the area). Wherever practical, auditors will be expected to observe\nthe cleaning in high\n\n- risk areas to ensure that the practices used are effective and that controls are in place to prevent this activity\nintroducing new risks.

End\n\n- consumer The ultimate consumer of a foodstuff, who will not use the food as part of any food business operation or\nactivity. Flow diagram A systematic representation of the sequence of steps or operations used in the production or\nmanufacture of a particular food item. Food defence Procedures adopted to ensure the safety of raw materials and\nproducts from malicious contamination or theft. Food fraud Fraudulent and intentional substitution, dilution or addition\nto a product or raw material, or misrepresentation of the product or material, for the purpose of financial gain, by\nincreasing the apparent value of the product or reducing the cost of its production. Food handler Anyone who handles or\nprepares food, whether open (unwrapped) or packaged. Food integrity Products that are of the nature, substance and\nquality expected (e.g. not substituted, diluted, adulterated or misrepresented). Food raw materials Food ingredients,\nadditives and processing aids used in the manufacture of a product. Food safety Assurance that food will not cause harm\nto the consumer when it is prepared and/or eaten according to its intended use. Food safety and quality culture The\nattitudes, values and/or beliefs which are prevalent at the site, relating to the importance of product safety and the\nconfidence in the product safety systems, processes and procedures used by the site.\n\nFood safety plan Often referred to as a HACCP plan. The food safety plan is a set of documents prepared in accordance\nwith the Codex Alimentarius HACCP principles to ensure the control of food\n\n- borne hazards. The specific terminology used in the Standard, such as ‘prerequisites’ and ‘critical control points’\n(CCPs), is intended to reflect the global terminology used to describe expectations. Sites are not required to use the\nspecific terminology in the Standard; alternatives are acceptable providing it is evident that all the requirements have\nbeen fully met. Food security Procedures adopted to ensure the continued availability of raw materials and products.\nFundamental requirement A requirement of the Standard that relates to a system which must be well established,\ncontinuously maintained and monitored by the company as absence or poor adherence to the system will have serious\nrepercussions on the integrity or safety of the product supplied. Genetically modified organism (GMO) An organism whose\ngenetic material has been altered by the techniques of genetic modification so that its DNA contains genes not normally\nfound there. Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) Managed by the Consumer Goods Forum, a project to harmonise and\nbenchmark international food safety standards (www.mygfsi.com). Good hygiene practice The combination of process,\npersonnel and/or service control procedures intended to ensure that products and/or services consistently achieve\nappropriate levels of hygiene. Good manufacturing practice (GMP) Implemented procedures and practices undertaken using\nbest\n\n- practice principles. Hazard An agent of any type with the potential to cause harm (usually biological, chemical,\nphysical or radiological). Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) A system that identifies, evaluates and\ncontrols hazards which are significant for food safety. High\n\n- care area A zone (or area) designed to a high standard where practices relating to personnel, ingredients, equipment,\npackaging and environment aim to minimise product contamination by pathogenic micro\n\n- organisms. High\n\n- care product A product that requires chilling or freezing during storage, is vulnerable to the growth of pathogens, has\nreceived a process to reduce the microbiological contamination to safe levels (typically 1–2 log reduction) and is ready\nto eat or heat. High\n\n- risk area A physically segregated zone (or area), designed to a high standard of hygiene, where practices relating to\npersonnel, ingredients, equipment, packaging and environment aim to prevent product contamination by pathogenic micro\n\n- organisms. High\n\n- risk product A chilled or frozen ready\n\n- to\n\n- eat/ready\n\n- to\n\n- heat product or food where there is a high risk of growth of pathogenic micro\n\n- organisms. Identity preserved A product which has a defined origin or purity characteristic which needs to be retained\nthroughout the food chain (e.g. through traceability and protection from contamination). Importer A company facilitating\nthe movement of products across an international border. Usually the first recipient of the products in that country. I\nIncident An event that has occurred that may result in the production or supply of unsafe, fraudulent, illegal or non\n\n- conforming products. Initial audit The audit for certification to a BRCGS standard at a company or site that is not in\npossession of a valid certificate. This may be the first audit at a site or a subsequent audit of a site whose\ncertification has lapsed. Inspection Targeted verification (often a visual check against a ‘tick list’ for fabrication,\nenvironment and equipment) to ensure operation to safe expected levels. Integrity See food integrity. Internal audit\nGeneral process of audit, for all the activity of the company. Conducted by or on behalf of the company for internal\npurposes. Job description A list of the responsibilities for a given position at a company. Key staff Those staff whose\nactivities affect the safety, legality, authenticity and quality of the finished product. Label Any tag, mark, picture\nor other descriptive matter, whether it is written, printed or otherwise marked, on or attached to the packaging of the\nproduct. Where a product is unlabelled, specifications or information to meet legal requirements and to assist customers\nin the safe usage of the product shall be maintained, and are included in the definition of a label. Labelling Any\nwords, picture or symbol relating to the food and placed on any packaging or label accompanying the product. Legality In\ncompliance with the law in the place of production and in the countries where the product(s) is/are intended to be sold.\nLot See batch. Low\n\n- risk area An area where the processing or handling of foods presents minimum risk of product contamination or growth of\nmicro\n\n- organisms, or where the subsequent processing or preparation of the product by the consumer will ensure product safety.\nMalicious contamination Deliberate contamination of a product or raw material with the intention to cause harm to the\nconsumer or damage to the company or brand owner. Manufacturer A company that produces product from raw materials and/or\ncomponents and packs the product or supplies product in bulk. A packer that packs product into retail units from bulk\n\n- supplied material can also be classed as a manufacturer. May Indicates a requirement or text which provides guidance but\nis not mandatory for compliance with the Standard.\n\nMeasurement uncertainty (sometimes referred to as uncertainty of measurement) A parameter that is associated with the\nresult of a quantitative measurement. It characterises the range of values that could reasonably be expected for the\nattribute being measured (e.g. the micro\n\n- organism, allergen or chemical). It is sometimes referred to as the margin of doubt for the result. Measurement\nuncertainty is important when making conformity decisions (i.e. assessing whether a test result is within legal, safe or\nacceptable limits) as the uncertainty or range of probable values may cross the limit. A full explanation of measurement\nuncertainty is given in the Global Standard Food Safety Interpretation Guideline for clause 5.6.2. Mitigation strategies\nControls to remove, or reduce to an acceptable level, an identified risk, vulnerability or threat. It is often used in\nfood defence where controls are needed to prevent potential threats from occurring. Monitoring A planned sequence of\nobservations or measurements of defined control parameters to assess whether predefined limits are being met. Non\n\n- conformity The non\n\n- fulfilment of a specified product safety, legal or quality requirement or a specified system requirement. Online\nverification equipment Automated equipment (e.g. bar code scanners) that are used to check the accuracy or quality of\nproduct labels and printing. Open product area An area in which product is open to the environment (i.e. not fully\nenclosed in packaging or within equipment/pipes). Outer packaging Packaging which is visible when the product is\nreleased from the site. For example, a cardboard box could be considered outer packaging even if wrapped in clear film.\nOutsourced processing (subcontracted processing) Outsourced processing (also referred to as subcontracted processing) is\nwhen intermediate production, processing, storage or a step in the manufacture of a product is completed at another\ncompany or site. Outsourced processing is an intermediate step; therefore during outsourced processing, the product or\npartly processed product leaves the site being audited for the completion of the outsourced processing before returning\nto the site. The audited site may or may not complete the additional packing or processing steps of the product. Where\nraw materials receive additional storage or processing prior to their arrival on site, this is not considered to be\noutsourced processing, but should be managed by the site using supplier approval mechanisms, raw material risk\nassessments and raw material specifications. When a product leaves the site and does not return, this is not outsourced\nprocessing; the activities completed off site are outside the scope of the audit. Ownership (change of company\nownership) A change of ownership occurs when the title is transferred from one individual or entity to another and\nresults in a change of control of the organisation. Performance indicators Summaries of quantified data that provide\ninformation on the level of compliance against agreed targets (e.g. customer complaints, product incidents, laboratory\ndata). Plant\n\n- based product A product that does not intentionally contain materials of animal origin, and has not intentionally used\ningredients (including additives, carriers, flavourings and enzymes), processing aids or any other substances that are\nof animal origin, at any stage during production and processing. I Position statement Where clarification of the\ninterpretation of a requirement of a BRCGS Standard or its protocol is necessary, this will be published on the BRCGS\nwebsite as a position statement. Such statements are binding on the way that the audit and certification process are\ncarried out and are considered to be an extension of the Standard. They are applicable from the date specified for\nimplementation (or the date of publication on the BRCGS website, where no date is specified). Positive release Ensuring\na product or material is of an acceptable standard prior to release for use. Potable water Water that is safe to drink,\nfree from pollutants and harmful organisms, and conforms to local legal requirements. Premises A physical building or\nplace owned by the company and audited as part of a site. Pre\n\n- packaged products Products in their final packaging that is designed for sale to the consumer. Prepared primary product\nA food product which has undergone a washing, trimming, size\n\n- grading or quality\n\n- grading process and is pre\n\n- packed. Prerequisite The basic environmental and operational conditions in a food business that are necessary for the\nproduction of safe food. These control generic hazards covering good manufacturing and hygiene practices, and form a\nfoundation for the food safety or HACCP plan. Prerequisites shall be considered as part of that plan. Preventive action\nAction to eliminate the fundamental underlying cause (root cause) of a detected non\n\n- conformity and prevent recurrence. Primary packaging The packaging that constitutes the unit of sale to the consumer or\ncustomer (e.g. bottle, closure, label and tamper\n\n- evident seal of a retail pack or a raw material bulk container). When identifying primary packaging, due consideration\nmust be given to the processes that minimise or eliminate any risk which may result in contamination of a food product;\nfor example:\n\n- using suitable food contact materials\n\n- consideration of anything that is applied onto the surface of a permeable food contact material (e.g. potential for\nmigration of ink components through cardboard is a well\n\n- documented risk that has affected a range of packaging). As a general rule, the Standard would not expect transit\nmaterials to be classified as primary packaging (e.g. pallets, pallet wrap, shrink wrap, pallet sheets, labels or cable\nties applied on the outside of the pallet wrap, recyclable and re\n\n- usable travel containers, and plastic crates used to hold glass bottles). Procedure Agreed method of carrying out an\nactivity or process which is implemented and documented in the form of detailed instructions or process description\n(e.g. a flowchart). Processed food A food product which has undergone any of the following processes: aseptic filling,\nbaking, battering, blending, bottling, breading, brewing, canning, coating, cooking, curing, cutting, dicing,\ndistillation, drying, extrusion, fermentation, freeze drying, freezing, frying, hot filling, irradiation,\nmicrofiltration, microwaving, milling, mixing, being packed in modified atmosphere, being packed in vacuum packing,\npacking, pasteurisation, pickling, roasting, slicing, smoking, steaming or sterilisation.\n\nProcessing aid Any substance not consumed as a food by itself, intentionally used in the processing of raw materials,\nfoods or their ingredients to fulfil a certain technological purpose during treatment or processing, and which may\nresult in the unintentional but technically unavoidable presence of the residues of the substance or its derivatives in\nthe final product – provided that these residues do not present any health risk and do not have any technological effect\non the finished product. Product recall Any measures aimed at achieving the removal of an unfit (e.g. unsafe) product\nfrom customers and final consumers. Product security For the purposes of the Global Standard Food Safety, product\nsecurity refers to measures to prevent theft or malicious damage to products. Product withdrawal Any measures aimed at\nachieving the removal of out\n\n- of\n\n- specification or unfit (e.g. unsafe) products from customers, but not from final consumers. A withdrawal is normally\nused to remove product where there is no risk to consumers; for example, where the product has not reached the point of\nsale to consumers. Production risk zones Zones or areas within the processing and storage facilities that require\nspecified levels of hygiene and segregation to reduce the potential for product contamination with pathogenic micro\n\n- organisms. The Standard recognises five production risk zones:\n\n- high risk\n\n- high care\n\n- ambient high care\n\n- low risk\n\n- enclosed product areas. Sites will also have a range of non\n\n- product areas which are separate from the processing and storage areas. Full details of the risk zones appropriate to\nthe Standard are located in Appendix 2 of the Standard.
