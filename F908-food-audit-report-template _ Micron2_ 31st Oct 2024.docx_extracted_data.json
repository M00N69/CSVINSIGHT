The policy is communicated to all staff e.g. posted on staff noticeboards and included in the staff induction programme.There is also a defined plan for the development and continual improvement of the food safety and quality culture, reference, yyyy-mm-dd. The plan is based on the key pillars of: People, Process, Purpose and Proactivity and demonstrated the site’s shared attitudes, values, ethos and beliefs relating to the importance of product safety and quality, which was led be leadership behaviours and management practices (and complied with BRCGS Position Statement F837).The plan (as discussed with ROLE) included defined improvement activities for all site sections impacting food safety e.g. [customise as required, include timescales]communication strategies to all levelsuse of culture surveys to benchmark the level of the ‘culture’ at the site and staff valuesstaff rewards and recognition programmestaff feedback mechanismstraining reviews e.g. updating refresher training programmes, delivery of safety culture presentationseffectiveness review of FSC activities undertakendoes the plan cover all departments onsite?   The above action plan was maintained with an annual or other more frequent review, last on yyyy-mm-dd.Measurable objectives to maintain and improve food safety, legality, authenticity and quality were documented, monitored and regularly reviewed by senior management quarterly or other more frequent, last on yyyy-mm-dd and were included as part of the annual management review agenda. Objectives included e.g. [customise as required, include timescales]review effectiveness of food safety and quality culture planProduction staff interviewed during the audit were able to demonstrate awareness of these policies, targets and objectives.A management review meeting is held annually or other more frequent, most recently on yyyy-mm-dd and was attended by all available Senior Management (e.g. ROLES). All required agenda items as required by the Standard were discussed e.g. [customise as required]the improvement objectivesreviews of internal or supplier auditslevel of complaintssafety or quality incidents and investigationsresourcingWhenever an objective or action would not be met, an investigation would be undertaken, the reason determined, and a revised objective or target would be set. Outputs from the management review meeting included future planned improvements and targets, which are communicated by team briefings and/or assignment of actions to relevant personnel. Additional monthly or other more frequent senior management meetings are scheduled to enable recent food safety, authenticity, legality or quality issues to be addressed, most recently on yyyy-mm-dd.A confidential reporting system for staff has been established to enable reporting and recording of concerns relating to food safety, authenticity, legality and quality directly to senior management. The reporting mechanism consisted of [details] and was clearly communicated to staff [e.g. when / how].Based on the evidence reviewed during this audit, the company appeared to provide sufficient human and financial resources to produce safe, authentic, legal food products in compliance with the Standard.Site management are aware of relevant legislative changes, scientific developments, codes of practice and emerging authenticity risks via: [customise as required]industry specific memberships (Campden BRI)local EHO / TSOexternal consultantFSA (alerts)web searchestrade magazine subscriptionsraw material suppliers and customersThe site holds a genuine copy of BRCGS Food Standard Issue 9 as a hard or electronic copy and they are aware of recent changes published on the BRCGS website. This announced or unannounced audit complied with the audit window requirements for recertification (re-audit date was yyyy-mm-dd), and the auditor was in production within 30 minutes of arriving on site [required for unannounced audits]. The audit opening and closing meetings were supported by senior management e.g. [roles present, include deputies if needed]. The XX major and XX minor non-conformances raised at the previous BRCGS audit have been resolved satisfactorily with action plans implemented and the root causes addressed. The site uses or does not currently use the BRCGS Logo[; usage and certification status were according to the BRCGS protocol (Part III Section 6.7 of the Standard)]. The site is registered as a food business operator by relevant authorities, [if required by legislation], with the latest local EHO site inspection on yyyy-mm-dd.A current comprehensive organisational structure indicating job functions and lines of communication had been established and was demonstrated by an organogram (ref, yyyy-mm-dd). The management team includes [customise roles e.g. CEO, MD, Operations Manager / Director, Technical Director / Manager, QA Manager, Chief Engineering Manager, HR Manager, NPD Manager]. Responsibilities are defined in job descriptions, e.g. role profiles, yyyy-mm-dd. Deputies in the absence of the responsible person are documented e.g. Technical Manager by QA Supervisor.Documented work instructions are in place and are accessible to the relevant personnel e.g. [customise with evidence seen e.g. recipes and process specifications, references, yyyy-mm-dd]. Staff interviewed were able to demonstrate that work is carried out in accordance with instructions.Staff are aware of the need to report unsafe or out-of-specification product, equipment, packaging or raw material to a designated manager [; any recent reporting and how / when resolved].The company do or do not currently make use of a food safety consultant to assist with the requirements of the standard[; however, the responsibility for management of the food safety systems remains with the company management].",

There is an allergen management procedure (ref, yyyy-mm-dd) which prevents cross-contamination by: physical or time segregation, use of dedicated allergen workwear, use of dedicated equipment and utensils, production scheduling, restrict movement of airborne dusts, waste controls, spillage controls, staff food restrictions, changeover clean downs between recipes (effective clean down observed on yyyy-mm-dd), segregated NPD materials, discard first few new recipe packs off of the packing line, dedicated labelled storage locations, awareness of worldwide customer allergen requirements (e.g. products exported to Canada / Japan).No rework or Rework material is controlled by reuse into like-for-like recipes only.No allergen warning labels are used or Allergen warning labels are used based on legislation, national guidelines, codes of practice. Any specific geographical legislative requirements for raw materials, the country of production and/or the destination country are managed.No suitability claims are made for allergens or food sensitivities or Allergen claims are made (e.g. gluten-free) which have been validated by product analysis (e.g. product XX on yyyy-mm-dd) and routinely verified.Fully validated cleaning procedures (e.g. ref, yyyy-mm-dd) are in place to minimise allergenic cross-contamination. Verification of cleaning effectiveness is by protein swabbing, analysis of final products for allergen presence. Cleaning equipment was seen to be satisfactory. Records of clean down practices and the controls (e.g. production scheduling) were seen (e.g. yyyy-mm-dd).It was (not) possible to witness the allergen management processes during a product changeover (e.g. XXX to XXX); all seen to be satisfactory.All employees have been trained in allergen awareness (e.g. initials on yyyy-mm-dd).",
